    "snippet": "What is DNS Over HTTPs (DoH)?Standard DNS (on tcp/udp port 53) works just fine but missing security features to prevent tampering of its plaintext DNS request to the DNS providers. It leads to security issues such as DNS Cache Poisoning and typo-squatting domains.DNS Over HTTPs (DoH) brings TLS/SSL encapsulation on HTTP traffic to boost security integrity issues of spoofing and tampering of DNS requests from clients to providers. In this article, i will refer DNS Over HTTPs as DoH abbreviation.The GoodThis brings better security for personal home network to prevent DNS based attacks and sniffing by attackers. You can find many DoH supported upstream providers and browser like Firefox already added this functionality in 2019 and started rolling out.  There are project that showing the possibility to set up DoH server and set up pi-hole to relay DoH instead of standard DNS.In general, this sounds like a good idea for individual users since it improves security of the DNS requests, however security professionals are pointing out caveats and challenges in enterprise network. Existing DNS security solution like DNS Sinkhole (which already have other issues) needs a redesign to support both DoH traffic and standard DNS traffic as fallback DNS request.The BadEnterprise network relies network security control and monitoring using standard DNS traffic and containment of malicious domains via DNS security solutions and sink-holing.There is SEI post from Carnegie Mellon University talks on 3 aspects to fight back risks bring from DoH. I want to comment on the points that we need to consider during executing these strategies:Strategy 1: Disable DoH in Managed Endpoints.  It is a plausible control to restrict configuration of DoH on applications to to whitelist applications if this aligns with organization security policies.Strategy 2: Block Known DoH Providers for Managed and Unmanaged Endpoints.  This is a bit of whack-a-mole approach to block DoH upstream DNS provides. As of 2022, even Google have DoH endpoints and if the enterprise solution starts using DoH on its products, admin going to need to whitelist these providers and this make things messier.The UglyStrategy 3: Assume Breach and Focus on Detection.  A secure way to establish DNS traffic brings unwanted audience whom are adversaries that are constantly seeking a better way to perform anomalous activities. To be able to detect DoH traffic among other HTTP, it needs a rethink of SIEM log collection and detection engineering as the start:          Security Operation needs to think of log collection to distinguish DoH traffic to merge in standard DNS traffic data model. RFC-8484 also describes the protocol description and implementation details.  There is already academic paper in researching a initial analysis on DoH traffic identification.      The following code snippets is HTTPS GET/POST requests and example response from DoH server.  It shows what ‚Äúapplication/dns-message‚Äù is the keyword to identify DoH Traffic.          # HTTP GET Request Sample of DoH traffic  :method = GET     :scheme = https     :authority = dnsserver.example.net     :path = /**dns-query**?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB     **accept = application/dns-message**          # HTTP POST Request Sample of DoH traffic  :method = POST     :scheme = https     :authority = dnsserver.example.net     :path = /dns-query     accept = application/dns-message     **content-type = application/dns-message**     content-length = 33         &lt;33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding&gt;     00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77     07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65  03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00     01          # HTTP Response Request Sample of DoH traffic  :status = 200     **content-type = application/dns-message**     content-length = 61     cache-control = max-age=3709         &lt;61 bytes represented by the following hex encoding&gt;     00 00 81 80 00 01 00 01  00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77     07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65  03 63 6f 6d 00 00 1c 00     01 c0 0c 00 1c 00 01 00  00 0e 7d 00 10 20 01 0d     b8 ab cd 00 12 00 01 00  02 00 03 00 04              Think of a way to include DoH traffic in TLS interception to have visibility of DoH traffic.      Detection engineer and Threat intel analyst requires to sit down together how to include existing detection use cases and upcoming scenarios to include DoH traffic.      Monitor new TTPs and approaches used by adversary to have a detection strategy to prevent potential attacks to the organization.        There are concerns and discussion in cybersecurity community on how to handle the risks of DoH with security controls. The protocol itself is in the early stage and there is still time for preparing to monitor and detect DoH traffic used by adversary. I‚Äôll write up on a specific procedural mitigation actions that security professionals can exercise.  "

    "snippet": "I have some down time at this week and decided to reinvent my blog site with new look and organization. This is the first entry after I redesigned and deployed this new site. Throughout the decision making process on the choice of platform and tools, I got some ideas and update to share with you, my friends..Platforms for blogging or NewslettersThere are criteria that helps to narrow down the options:  Free or Paid Options üí∞  Self-hosted website, social media or community platforms? üè†  Type of content? (blogs, art/design or professional articles) üßëüèº‚Äçüé®  Support of newsletter integration and comment üì∞  Technical capability of you or your team (custom domain setup, Hosting setup, CMS knowledge, VCS, CI/CD flow, General Web Development skills) ü•∑üèªOptionsThese questions will give a guideline on the path that you can decide for your blog or portfolio website.  The following mind map shows a glance of the options that you can pick from.It‚Äôs a lot of options but after browsing through some of these services, you will have an initial idea of the blogging platform that can fit your requirement.As for non-technical friends that want to kick start a blog, a site like Medium or Ghost is a good start for general bloggers and SubStack for professional writers.I included ‚ÄúBy Technology‚Äù for developers and technical guys who want to study or build a website based on a particular JS framework such as Hexo and Jekyll.Another interesting choice for Notion.so user is blog based on Notion with no-brainer setup.Why I select GitHub Pages for bloggingIf you knows a bit of web development and CI/CD flow, there are options that you can craft website with template and customize before hosting to the hosting services ranged from Github to AWS. This is a decision making flow for mine:  I was not looking for community blogs like Medium as primary site.  I don‚Äôt want to pay for subscription for using platform except custom domain set up.  I want to maintain all my blog posts in markdown format locally as backup and also want to customize theme and custom domain.  Jekyll is my choice of tech stack with markdown editor support  I mostly blog text with few images.  I just want to use GitHub to maintain source code and content.I was using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for ~5 years and it is a good option for tech savvy want to try small website.  It is relatively easy to start with user.github.io domain that you can set up custom domain. Remember, It‚Äôs ONLY for a static page website and NOT ideal for web applications. I do have Medium account that I posted some of the blogs from my main site as a way to promote using its strong community users.Other considerations  It is always ideal to choose the platform or approach that you can backup or export out your blogs for migration to another platform. To avoid platform lock-in.  Markdown is a must-know markup language for bloggers because many of the platform relies on it. OR use Notion.so for markdown writing and export it out.  Git version control system if you maintain blog site by yourself.  Boosting SEO and audience is always a challenge if you set up a self-hosted site or from scratch.  Communication channel and newsletter integration is not available in free platforms and it needs 3rd party integrations or paid tier in the platforms.  Custom domain needs to purchase by yourself from namecheap.com or godaddy.com and most freemium sites required a paid tier to set it up.I hope I help you jumpstart your blogging journey and if there is any questions upon the points I take or mistakes, DM me at twitterüê¶."

    "snippet": "A look back into 2021, it‚Äôs not the year that I achieve something to proud of. The mental state of mind is not the best and the way that I look into life and the world is changed. The motherland is in turmoil and approaching to become a failed-state. Uncertainty is very high in all citizens, the people who can enjoy their lives with whatever they have. This is far worse than pandemic because the fix to this political conflict can‚Äôt be methodological. People falls into 4 categories; the ones that trying to maintain the wealth and status, the ones that rival against the junta power, the one that neutral and play the dances, the ones that support one of the sides."

    "snippet": "2020 is a tough year for everyone. For me, there is some months like house arrest alone. A year passed by and we are in 2021 with changes in our daily life style and the way we live, work and enjoy life. People are fighting for this virus outbreak but most people believe in our survival instinct and health system.As for burmese citizens including me, 2021 Feb military coup is another misery added up to already-been messed up sitiation. It‚Äôs a sensitve topic to discuss for non-political minded like me, however this is a big upset and unethical approach taken by the junta militray to the public. Sometimes, people are blinded for one‚Äôs personal agenda. This is understanable until it affects to ten of thousands of peope. As the other days, I saw a post on social media of the comparison between how many people are dead from Covid-19 and junta massacre is like 500 fold of the virus. I used to think that black sheep are a lonesome outcast and in this case, the hatred of a group of people with a blinded leader becomes a back sheep flock.I came from a political parent who suffers from the past coup and how brutal the military tatics on this matter based on his life-long story. However, this time, things are not gonna turn out like the same outcome with the commitment and mindset of the public. You can jail a person but his or her mind. You can kill a person but not his or her belief. This is not a political warfare for Burmese citizens, it‚Äôs a nation state warefare and freedom violated.In a time like this, it is important to focus on the mind, more than the situation. We took care of ourselves, our family, our neighbors and so on and show what do we believe and stand for sto the world."

    "snippet": "Why CISSPWell, this is the credential for security practioners like us that hard to prove the market that ‚ÄúI kinda of know what I am doing and would like HR personnel to make their job easier‚Äù. A bit of morale dellima in taking this exam but I have to say the learning experience and knowlege gain is worth the pain. This is a bit of extension on what I jot down at reddit post.Since I am already in ISC2 circle with SSCP, this is economical since the annual fee is fixed for no matter how many ISC2 credentials you hold. A good alternative can be CISM from ISACA with another 150 bucks more.CISSP MindsetI‚Äôll write it down in a cluster non-structured form with points of some mindset and preapation after passing the exam:  There is no definite bullet-proof preparation for this exam. You might ask how to approach this exam with high success rate. 3 big criteria is Actual experience, critical thinking as risk advisory &amp; reading recommended books to pick up your weak domains to research and to understand more on some concepts.  Reddit Entry on preparion and resources.It‚Äôs quite a head scratcher and some questions are repeating with different approach to validate your understanding of the topic.Exam cram is quite important to catch up domains or topics you like to forget. I did a lot of logical grouping of technical/ non-technical concepts to make it easy to rule out the noise in multiple choice. There is several questions that I didn‚Äôt understand or know at all but smart guess and exam strategy does the job.Resources:1.CISSP Offical Study Guide 8th Edition: The main source of information that I relied on because it is easier to absorb than CBK. ONLY rely process such as risk management process, change management from this book. Other books will make you confused. Read this book like 4 times in different aspects to grasp most of the concepts and theories. Take notes of stuffs you don‚Äôt understand and research online until you get it clearly and note it down what you research to read it when it is like one or two weeks before exam.2.CISSP in 10 Hours: Read it like a magazine to find out anything missing form book #1.3.CISSP 21 days: Conceptual digram from this book is quite good to understand big picture of each domains. You can read it all technical stuffs from this books but stick process from book 1.4.CISSP Offical CBK: Try to read but make me confused and skip.5.CISSP Shon Harris Practice Exams: I tried all questions. It‚Äôs even harder than the actual exam. Quite painful but the reasoning on each questions help you learn something you don‚Äôt know or missed to learn.      CISSP Offical Practice Test 2nd Edition: I practiced this book twice. The 2nd time to revisit wrong answers I did the first time after going through book #1 2nd time.        Memory Place 2nd edition : Quite useful and it is based on book #1. Even though it is missing some important concepts, it can become your exam cram after adding missing stuffs by yourself.        Make quizlet based on book #7 but didn‚Äôt finish and use it. (exam note)[https://quizlet.com/527740764/exam-notes-flash-cards/?i=33vbln&amp;x=1jqY]  "

    "snippet": "IntroductionFirstly, Let start with the difference between Indicator of Compromise (IOCs)  and Indicator of Attacks (IOAs). In daily security operations, we are using these terms interchangeably, however it is better to understand the accurate meanings.IOAs can describe the active attack series by adversary that is occurring in real time which is via real time monitoring and detection.The security sensors and security analysts can detect and escalate IOAs such as malicious IPs probing network, repetitive malware infection on a particular host, established inbound/outbound connections to IP from a country that the organization don‚Äôt deal business.IOCs shows the evidence and artifacts left by attackers such as running malware process, dropped malware in system, and logs that show adversary lateral movement. These indicators can use to clean up and identify the compromised hosts in the organization and to create custom signatures for detection.In this piece,  it describes the importance of IOCs in Incidence Response, especially in Investigation process and creation &amp; deployment of IOCs.  By comparing with IOAs &amp; IOCs, most security folks are more familiar with IOCs due to the community effort to share, maintain and contribute the artifacts from the incidents.IOCs FundamentalsIOC lifecycle composes of the creation of IOCs from incidents, sharing the IOCs via Threat intel platform and correlation and enrichment of  IOCs and archiving and categorization. To share different type of IOCs , security practitioners come up with standardized protocols such as OpenIOC,Yara, CyboX, STIXX and STAXX.  It is out of scope to compare and discuss the pros and cons of these standard and I will leave that for further research. Another must-know protocol is called TLP (Traffic Light Protocol) which uses 4 color grades to describe sharing boundaries of the information.Many commercial and open source platforms are available that security practitioners can contribute and look for IOCs and the attack trends. Go to AlienVault OTX, ThreatConnect, Talos Intelligence, VirusTotal to get an idea of the platforms and type of IOCs available among them.  For e.g., AlienVault OTX curates list of IPs, malware hashes, domains, emails of a particular malware based on third-party resources such as blogs, news and threat research article. VirusTotal is not IOCs platform, which is more of a lookup database to check the URL,IPs or hashes is malicious or not by the examiners (AV Engines) .IOCs Use CaseIn general, IOCs can help in preventing attacks before it happens proactively  and to use it during incident response.The entry level use case for IOC is matching and correlation with logs that maintain in SIEM system via Threat Intel application.  It can reveal and discover the inbound IPs that inside your network or the C2 callback server  from your internal network that can‚Äôt identify by the existing security monitoring tools.Another typical source type that is important to correlate is with DNS logs. The reason behind that is because some RAT and APT traffic don‚Äôt support DNS log and there is no app log or else.Having IOCs and other sources that can flag malicious traffic and malware is not having  threat intel. Threat Intel platform or provider analyzes and forwards a very specific threat indicators that relate to your organization‚Äôs region, sector and known target threat adversary that CISO and management needs to focus on.Types of IOCsThere is a term called Pyramid of Pain by FireEye Mandiant that presents the pain points and how difficult to maintain the Threat Intel data.The listing of IOCs type is also in the order of least painful and easy to use threat intel data to the most difficult ones. The attached pdf also contains more detail information with example of each.  Hashes: SHA1,MD5 hashes of malware executables, PE files and malicious attachments that you can look up or create ones that you collect. Most folks call this as creating custom malware signatures.  IPs:  Known malicious C2 IPs, low reputation IPs.  Domains: Domain names of a bunch of domain name with sub-domains used by attackers  Network/Host Artifacts: Anything that left as evidence by attackers in network traffic level and host level. Normally, sandbox and simulating the malware artifacts  can reproduce the changes in file system and registry keys and in memory level.  Tools: Like us, adversary implements software to do the bad things. Mitre ATTCK  has a list of known software users by adversay.  TTPs : It stands for Tactis, Techniques and Procedures used by attackers. Basically, it provides the entire operation of adversary. A successful TTPs threat intel can provide the entire cyber attack kill chains of threat campaigns. Ref: https://rvasec.com/slides/2014/Bianco_Pyramid%20of%20Pain.pdfOutroThe bottom line is IOCs is a good starting point but it is not the end of Threat Intel program.  Leverage and use the IOCs and threat intel to your security operation to improve KPIs and pinpointing the attacks before it‚Äôs too late."

    "snippet": "A state of MindUnlike other  penetration testing techniques, business logic testing gives a headache to most beginner testers. This is an a testing area that the testers with application mind can find a way in better than professionals comes from network &amp; system background. This post is not a ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù techniques of how to exploit the web application.  This is more of ideas that what the developers might do wrong in their application design, forgotten security requirements and implementation issues.Mythical MitMMitM attacks or attempts is something developers think it is not gonna occurs. Nobody will try to intercept this communicational channels. The communication channel is secure and it‚Äôs good enough.  All of these assumptions are not correct.Even though the name applies ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù,  it is more of the attackers pretends to be either sender or receiver and the attack surface is not in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù.  So, it is important to understand all sensitive information and API calls need to be comprehended by the attackers using simple proxy tool by setting up as ad-hoc connection.I discovered several vulnerabilities that causes by abusing the application functions due to limited security measures set to back-end API calls.Encryption is only for passwordsEncryption/ decryption is to ensure the message is confidential during the data-in-transit and data-at-rest.  It supposes to exercise on all sort of ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù, not only for passwords. The examples of secrets can be credit card information, user identity, credit card data, and any sensitive information. For e.g., the payment function transfer money from user 1 to user 2, it is important to encrypt the user id that attackers can‚Äôt decode easily.Payment gateway is secure MythPayment gateway API process the payment made by your application end user but it is important to make sure that the credit card information, the payee and payer information need to be encoded to increase the obfuscation that the attacker can‚Äôt digest easily. Just by hijacking the session and modifying the payee information can make a lot of issues to your application payment and its business.There is no Cookie MonsterHTTP cookie lets you keep information in your end-user device.  The general idea is to ensure PII and credentials are not exposed and all information needs to encrypt.  If your application uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transmit, do implement your cookie information to secure as well via secure flag and HttpOnly. Otherwise, the monster will find a way to eat your cookies.  If the attackers can bypass your authentication scheme, the business impact is critical.Attackers don‚Äôt forget passwordsThere is no such standard to implement ‚ÄúForget Password‚Äù function. However, it is required to design a balance between user experience and security. If it‚Äôs too easy to request passwords by just knowing the email address of user name, the attackers likely to mess around by bully requesting passwords of a victim. By combining  end-user personal information plus public information or out-of-bound authentication makes things a lot safer and the attacker is not likely to guess your first girlfriend name. :DSum upAs for the penetration testers without development background, it sounds like a guess work. The way to think is to identify business logic issues is to predict the ‚Äúsecurity debt‚Äù and functional flaws made by the programmers.I hope this write-up helps. As for the testing methods and more tips, OWASP testing guideline is a good starting point."

    "snippet": "IntroIf you are a new Mac user and looking for a list of MacOS apps to install, this piece might help you into doing that. It is not an easy job to find the best of the best tools out there that will help your job. After I bought my first MacBook, I spent sometime looking on internet setting up their MacOS and I didn‚Äôt find a general article of the essential apps that I normally use and it triggers me to write this blog piece and the tools are just a selection based on my preferences.Initial CleanupAfter the initial setup, MacBook comes with pre-loaded softwares. Some of them are useful for me such as Garage Band and you can remove it easily to safe up storage. One thing to notice when uninstalling Mac apps is that the applications can remove easily by deleting it, however the resources file are orphaned in the file system.  Using App Uninstaller or CleanMyMac do a good job cleaning up these leftover files.The next step is go to ‚ÄúSystem Preferences‚Äù and play around and change the look and feel as you want. Setting up iCloud and App Store gives some weird errors for me. Just restart the machine and give it a try. It works.There are some people having battery draining issue in macOS Mojave and it requires terminal to resolve and verify this issue. Find details at  How to Fix macOS Mojave Battery Draining Issue - AppleToolBox.Follow this principle on charging MacBook: ‚ÄúCharge when it below 20% while using it and unplug it at 95% and Repeat.‚Äù The small menu app ‚Äùbattery monitor‚Äù can give you notification.What Accessories to get?  A hard cover and a fabric or leather bag (optional)      2 adapters if you have 2 thunder ports (New MacBook Pro 2018 or MacBook Air 2018);          A USB C to VGA/HDMI combo adapter      A USB C to 4 or 5 USB 3 ports        If you only have 1 thunder port 3, get a USB hub that has 4 USB 3 ports with HDMI plus USB C port for charging.  It seems crazy but you can find a cheap one at Alixpress.Secure the OSIf you are comfortable with terminal, use GitHub - alichtman/stronghold: Easily configure macOS security settings from the terminal.  to tune security configuration of your MacBook.Another way is to  set up manually by doing these things:* Turn on Firewall* Turn FileVault on * Install reliable Antivirus software* Change General Settings from Security &amp; PrivacyInvesting  a few bucks on reliable antivirus and malware remover is a good idea to prevent known and unknown attacks and ransomware.General Utility ToolsThe following utility tools are free and quite handy in general.

    "snippet": "BackgroundIt is important to know about ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù culture before starting to understand ‚ÄúDevSecOps‚Äù. The reason behind this is that DevOps is an underlying building block of DevSecOps which brings the attribute of speed, precision and automation. The core principles of DevOps is to deliver software faster and more reliable by designing automated integration and delivery pipeline with collaboration of Development and Operation team. Even with reliable process and technology, people plays a critical part to adopt DevOps mindset and culture.The need for Security in the DevOps pipeline itself and the developing software brings security aspect of software development and the term DevSecOps is born. The nature of Security is allergic reaction to Dev team and Ops team which makes it a big burden to interoperable in SDLC process.DevSecOps = Secure DevOps?The Short answer is Yes.The idea of Developer centric approach is essential to implement DevSecOps program by adopting security tools/process focus on developers, not the conventional security testing process. Choose the tools that developers can work within their development environment. Choose the process that operation team can integrate with CI/CD chain and enjoy automating security testing.When we say Left-Shift testing approach, we are implying 2 objectives; testing as early as possible and mitigating vulnerabilities continuously throughout Development. By testing as early development stage, stubborn vulnerabilities are mitigated and the effort is less than fixing during testing phase or deployment phase. There might be some people thinking how about we fix it all at 1 point. 100% secure software is impossible and it is important to brings justification on security risk assessment and prioritization. Continuous Security Monitoring is required to compensate residual risks and zero vulnerabilities.Who is Security Champion?A new DevSecOps team in your organization needs a hero called Security Champion. He/She is top-notch developer with security in mind. He/She has a strong desire and mission to ‚Äúsecure all applications‚Äù motto. Security champion can talk developers language and also can communicate with security brokers and he/she knows when to raise the issues. This role also involves promoting the security awareness and secure coding practices to all developers.In my opinion, this is one important model that management should prioritize when forming a DevSecOps team. At the end of the day, DevSecOps culture is the main drive that will keep the entire DevSecOps process effectively.Everyone is security engineerSecurity team controls the security posture of the applications is not working anymore. Everyone needs to become aware of their security responsibilities. To order to fulfill the skills gap and security knowledge, the security professional should introduce development team about secure software development, vulnerabilities that lies in open source components, understanding of the security issues &amp; remediation guideline, security testing solutions in DevSecOps. On the other hand, security professionals should learn new skills to collaborate with development team, fundamental knowledge of software development, consulting and understanding of the issues from developer perspective.What about AppSec Pipeline?OWASP AppSec Pipeline adopts the principles of DevOps into application security program. There is some articles that mentions DevSecOps is the next generation of AppSec Pipeline. In my opinion, I believe AppSec pipeline is still a suitable program for organizations that want to decrease complexity of DevOps pipeline and segregation of duty between Development/Operation and Security.OutroThis is a just a fragment of thoughts on DevSecOps on some common questions that I am having. Continuous learning is a key for developing skills and knowledge that everyone in the DevSecOps team can practice to build a world class software development program. OWASP DevSecOps Studio is a good starting point for people who wants to dive in to learn DevSecOps concepts right away."

    "snippet": "I passed SSCP certification exam from ISC2 recently. The post is to share preparation tips and reasons to take this exam. There is not a lot of posts on Internet about SSCP prep since it‚Äôs not quite a popular exam and I hope this article helps people who decided to take SSCP.Why SSCPThe first thing is to understand SSCP exams and its nature. IMO, it‚Äôs entry-mid level exam with focusing to examine technical/administrative thinking for security practitioners. It‚Äôs also a very good starter exam for those who can‚Äôt obtain CISSP due to lack of working experience or knowledge. I decided to take  SSCP instead of CISSP due to shortage of 5 years working experience. Moreover, I believe this exam covers a good learning path and can transfer knowledge for CISSP exam in the future. Moreover, you can waive 1 year working experience to pursue CISSP after obtaining SSCP. Apart from SSCP, there are several alternative good exams from SANS,CompTIA and so on. Still, CISSP from ISC2 is the de-facto standard in terms of knowledge coverage and job opportunity and it becomes a clear choice for most cybersecurity professionals.PreparationThere are so many approaches people prepare for ISC2 exams and it depends on you as well. you can start by selecting self-study, taking class and online-learning. I decided to read 2 books and take notes and mind map for the recap. The first primary book is ISC2 SSCP Official Study Guide from Sybex. It‚Äôs important Not to skip this book because it is designed to cover all 7 domains and topics and technical terms used in the book are the same with the questions from exam. Make sure to find the latest edition at the time of taking exam. The second book is SCP Systems Security Certified Practitioner All-in-One Exam Guide, Second Edition. I uses the all-in-one book as reference and didn‚Äôt read back to back. it‚Äôs good to read for a particular topic that you are not quite good at it and want to improve your understanding. I didn‚Äôt take any practice tests but it is recommended by most people who take ISC2 exam. There are people who suggests about things like brain dumps and stuffs. I don‚Äôt recommend it because I believe we should embrace the learning process and earn the certification.SSCP Exam NatureThe exam questions are not long and you have plenty of time of think, write it down to get to the MOST correct answer. Some questions can have more than 1 correct answer and your job is to simulate the question as a real scenario to pick the ideal ones. The exam requires critical thinking to get the correct answer and make sure to review the questions you have doubt. No need to rush.There are 125 questions for 3 hours and you have 1.5 mins per question to answer, which is plenty of time. Concentrate and put all the things you read from your brain and make a logical decisioning.Endorsement ProcessAfter you passed CAT exam, the next step is to go through endorsement process and follow the instructions that send to your email by ISC2. Online endorsement from ISC2 makes the process quite convenient and ease to process.Additional Reference:Official SSCP Exam Page"

    "snippet": "I am writing this after a year using Pebble Time. I bought it the day I heard company is gone but still it's going this far. I shout out to pebble team and a bit to Fitbit for making it happen.Pebble server will down at 30th June 2018. Features that requires online services will be lost for pebbler. Some can live with that but most people might not satisfy with partial malfunction devices. Fibit offering all pebble users $50 discount for Fibit Ionic. It is a budget choice for a good smartwatch but what are the alternatives out there?I get rid of watches with Apple &amp; Andriod Wear ecosystem in this selection. This is more of smart watches with own OS. There is not a lot of choice though smart watch market is going slow..TicwatchTicwatch offers a range of watches for both iOS and Android users. In terms of price &amp; function ratio, Ticwatch is a good choice. Battery life is a big drawbacks of ticwatch but usability of TicOS is very appealing. This is a brand to consider if you are not into Apple watch and Android Wear watch. They do offers affordable Android Wear based watch as well.AmazfitAmazfit is the cheapest option and they have Pebble clone version called Amazfit Bip too. Amazfit Bip has month long battery life and pebble like screen but the ecosystem is nothing to compared with Pebble. Amazfit Pace is a premium piece but it looks too ugly for me. The best place to buy these watches is from Aliexpress but pay attention to pick ones with English version.Hybrid WatchThis is a thing for people with style but still want to catch smartwatch features. I am not a big fan of this category but there is definitely a demand for business people because it goes along with formal wear. Fossil, Nokia, Misfit &amp; Garmin and several luxury watch brands has hybird watches category with different taste. Check out Wearables article for more information.GarminGarmin is a strong branding and favor among hard-core runners and outdoor adventures for its reliable GPS and rough design. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but I never heard people complaining about their Garmin devices.FitbitThere are options out there but you don‚Äôt like any of them. Go for Fibit since there is a chance of seeing Pebble-like features sooner or later. Compare with Ticwatch &amp; Amazfit, it‚Äôs more reliable and better looking UI. With $50 discount, I think it is not gonna damage your wallet that much. For online reviews, this is a good watch for cardio type exercises and also fit for daily use.Come on..my pebble is still workingOk.. If you are Android user, there are way to keep your pebble working like before. GadgetBridge is an open-source android app to keep your watch data on device and can mirror notifications and sideload apps withtout relying on vendors‚Äô apps. Rebble project is also another project that trying to keep pebble alive."

    "snippet": "AV is not enough protection for the new era of cyber attack paradigmRecently, I‚Äôve been using more than AV for my work PC to tighten the security. The landscape of the attackers is expanding to more scary things like ransomware attacks and I think it is important for everyone to understand what is ransomware. ESET Ransomware Explained(vid) is also a short nice video of what ransomware capable of. AV can‚Äôt detect and prevent them. The attackers are more clever than ever to construct a payload that can exploit the system without the knowledge of AVs. Behavioral monitoring is necessary to detect these next generation attacks. There is ton of security practices for end-users to avoid these exploits from getting inside the system. Check NoMoreRansom project for preventive measures. To get latest news and ransomware information, Ransomwares is a great source. Sophos Anti-Ransomware kit contains impressive resource to learn about ransomwares.Preventive MeasuresThis is the list of security tools that we can use to prevent the rasomware and exploits.Data backup schemeThere are several ways to backup your data; cloud back up or hardware appliances or both. Lacie makes high-end storage products but costly. I uses WD Passport that capable of hardware encryption and utility program that backup data automatically.  For insensitive data, it is ‚Äúok‚Äù to back up to cloud storage services but keep in mind that data is at risk.Network Monitoring toolYes. Turn on default Windows Firewall. It‚Äôs a must. What we can do more is by using a firewall with advanced features that give you visual information and alerts on real-time of network traffic and new initiated connections. I use glasswire for this purpose and free version is a good start for everyone. The alternatives are Comodo Firewall, NetWrox, and so on.Endpoint Security solutionsThere are several solutions that detects prevents malwares and ransomware attacks. These tools monitor and detect the behaviors of ransomwares continuously and remediate the exploits. Some popular vendors are Sophos, Bitdefender, Kapersky, Trend Micro, Malwarebytes, Sophos, Carbonblack, and so on. Do the research for the best product that can prevent evolved and sophisticated ransomwares before selecting it.Post-RansomwareOk! we fail to protect ourselves. Before paying to the devil attackers, these are the process we can try to decrypt/recover ransomware.Ransomware DecryptorsFor some common rasomware variants, you can check decryptors tool at Ransomwares. NoMoreRasomware also have a collection of decryptors from R&amp;D team of several security vendors.Community HelpIf the decryptors are not working, Crypto Shrieff is a community program to fight rasomware and help you to decrypt the keys.Data Recovery SolutionsThis is for the scenario that you don‚Äôt have any backups and none of the above steps work. Prosoft, KrollonTrack and SEAGATE offers great data recovery programs that you can try without buying at first. In that way, you can evaluate how many percentage of data loss can recover.If you have the big question of why we are bothering recover tool since it costs money as well as paying the attackers. Check the answer from this Should We Recover Files From Ransomware ‚Äì Is It Safe.EpilogueRansomware is a new breed and not as popular as malwares or virus. However, there is a great chance that it can be infected our system. Attackers are taking advantages of end-user having no-knowledge on this attack type and penetrating through the vulnerabilities of the system easily. So, upgrade our knowledge and update the endpoint security stacks to attack against ransomwares."

    "snippet": "A question of ‚Äúwhat to possess and why I have them?‚ÄùWomen buy things they fancy. The same applies to men. Men even fall into the category of buying things that are useless and not make life more organizing and productive. I am the kind of guy beat myself up when I end up owning some stupid things. I believe in minimalism and the concept of ‚Äúbuying less‚Äù and live simply. It makes my life easy and declutter without chaos in your room. I only buy things I really need, I find it elegant and beauty in it.This is more of a personal note of why I own and planning to buy. Of course, I have more of the small items that civilized humans need like cleaning products and bedsheets. This is more of some items that I am doubtful to own but end up being useful to me. There are many similar posts on the Internet and you can google it to get a thought or two.A Job that you loveWithout this item, the possession of these materials is impossible. If you are unemployed, stop reading and go get a job or start a business.ElectronicsE-book readerIf you like to expand your knowledge and stimulate your thoughts and idea, reading is the essential habit to build up. Actual books are good if you have money and spaces for it. I bought a kindle e-book reader and it don‚Äôt let me down and boost my reading. Just get any reliable e-book reader and you will not disappointed. Don‚Äôt ask me why not a LCD tablet. I know it can do more but it can‚Äôt be a dedicated book reading gadget and distraction of course‚Ä¶laptopIf you are not a gamer and graphic designer, a laptop is suitable for all sort of professions. It‚Äôs small, mobile and easy to maintain. If you are fancy getting a desktop PC, ask yourself why. Do I need a resource intensive computer system? Do I need to replace and upgrade hardware components in the near future? If the answers is no,go get a laptop.Laptop ergonomics standIf you are a heavy computer user that spends like 9-10 hours in front of the screen, this is one definite thing to own. Brands and variations don‚Äôt matter. Feel it and get one. All you need is the one that can rise up the URL bar to your eyes level. Save your neck with a few pennies!!Smart TV BoxI am not talking about smart TV. It‚Äôs expensive and the features are limited. It can be android,Roku or Apple TV box that you can connect with any TVs that have HDMI connectivity. I got an android TV box with my personal setup and the things that little box can do please me well.Sound-barBig speakers and entertainment systems are awesome! It produces great sound but make your living room ugly. I recently bought a 100$ samsung sound-bar with wireless &amp; bluetooth connectivity and 80w power is loud enough for my small living room.On-ear headphoneIt doesn‚Äôt matter you like it or not. Get one to save your ear damage from prolonged usage of in-ear headphone. It can also blocks distraction at work and put a sign that says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt f#$&amp;ing tap me if it‚Äôs not important enough‚Äù.ClothingSneakers/Running ShoeIf you don‚Äôt have either sneaker or running shoe, you are definitely living in a cave. A good pair of running shoe is suitable not only for exercising but also for outdoor walking and strolling around the town.ShoesUnfortunately, my job have strict dress-code and can‚Äôt wear casually. Black &amp; Brown leather shoes boost up your look and go for the pointy ones but not too pointy though. A square closed shoe just looks ugly.SuitFor occasional ceremony, a good tailored suit is a must-have for all grow-up men but not a fancy color. Go for a classic decent looking color that match your style and taste.Knit TieA knit tie is something you can wear it to dress up or down. I ordered one from China and it is surprising good quality. It is consider as more casual than woven tie but it seems ok for South East Asia.Dress shirtIt should contrast with the suit you are wearing it with. For e.g, if the suit color is navy blue, the dress shirt should be white or a color that is lighter than navy blue. Also,beware of the size;being too fit or too loose.Casual BlazerThis is the piece of clothes that can go with most of your other clothes; tee,t-shirt,jeans,pants or even shorts! It makes you get a look that some people called it ‚Äúsmart casual‚Äù and the occasions that you don‚Äôt want to look too formal and this piece of clothing solves the problem.Oxford ShirtThis is another clothes that can go with anything. Go for long sleeves because you can fold the sleeves up anyhow.BeltsTry to get a color matched belt for your leather shoes. Wearing different color of belt and shoe just look odd. For casual look, you can go creative.KitchenElectronics PotThis is one essential item that involves making a simple home brew coffee, boiling water for instant noodle or to thaw a frozen chicken.Electronic Pan/ Slow CookerI got a inexpensive slow cooker that I used to cook many dishes. It works well except take time to fry meat.Rice Cooker1 definite cooking appliance for all Asians!!Blender/JuicerI bought A Phillips blender just to make smoothie and juice since the ones that can buy from the shop is just pricey.AccessoriesA walletIt don‚Äôt need to be a fancy expensive brand. Just a nice genuine leather wallet that suits your style and preference. I don‚Äôt have a lot of cards and a slim leather wallet with clip-on is worked for me.NotebooksTo write down daily focus tasks, your thoughts, a quick gist of things and learning process! I still can‚Äôt replace actual blank notebooks with a digital gadget like tablet. Checkout bullet journal to find out the effective organization method.Planner/OrganizerI still love a thin monthly calendar with square blocks that you write and draw things freely. I use this kind of planner for my focus tasks and monthly objectives. I also use e-calendar for meeting calls and work related matter.A water bottle/mugMy choice of mug is the mighty mug and it serves me well after 1 year of use.Portable chargerI don‚Äôt own a extra juice for my gadgets because i am mostly aware of my device battery level. Just a portable small charger to go is enough to plug in wherever I want."

    "snippet": "I am writing this post with 1 week experience of Pebble Time.Well..Pebble company vanished on 7 Dec 2016 that is the day I got my first Pebble watch. I heard the news that Fitbit is buying some assets of Pebble and I read a post that says something like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a time to buy one if u want it‚Äù. I want Pebble since the first OG but I didn‚Äôt have a chance to buy it for several reasons. Now, I am capable of having one easily from local reseller and just a thought of ‚Äúwhy I should not own one now?‚Äù.I ordered it from e-commerence site and it arrives the exact day the company shuts down. I was having doubt that should I return it or keep it. In my unconscious mind, I want to keep it and after resolving what I want from a smart-watch, I decided to keep it. This is a list of what I want want from a smart-watch at this time of writing:1. Clock, Alarm, &amp; Timer2. A quick glance of notification before reaching the phone4. Good Battery life5. Sort of activity tracking (even though I didn't care much but it's cool to have it.)6. Water Resistance7. Remotes for Kodi and SpotifyI tested Gadgetbridge and it seems pretty ok for most of the features. I don‚Äôt know about third-party apps support and which apps are working yet. Android watch is buggy and don‚Äôt have smooth experience. I also prefers gadgets with nice UI/UX that lacks in most of the smart-watches. I will stick to this extinct smart-watch as far as I can.If there is a community support continuing the ecosystem of pebble OS, I might get PB2 or more. I feel quite positive about this too."

    "snippet": "I wrote on a quora thread about Technology changes in my motherland, Myanmar. A freelance journalist from WEIRD magazine caught an interest on the answer with some follow-up questions. He is working on a piece about technolgy changes and impact on Burmese citizen or similar topic. I took this as a change to write my personal story of what I went through and how I expose to technology and working as a career in IT.I wrote it on a limited time due to my busy schedule lately. It‚Äôs more like a drafting and bear with it. I recommend to start with the Quora answer and go on the questions.First Q&amp;A1) What incidents were you referring to when you wrote about the following?  How do you think that people respond to the internet when they don‚Äôt know how to use the internet ‚Äúproperly and legally‚Äù?  Do you think Burmese people were prepared to so suddenly get access to the internet?‚ÄúThe first major problem that causes from exposing internet is breaking cyber ethics and internet laws. The first reason is because people don‚Äôt have fundamental knowledge about ‚Äúhow to use internet properly and legally?‚Äù. There are several incidents that happen at 2014 from social media platform due to the breaking of internet law (which people don‚Äôt know).‚ÄùFacebook is the main social media that Burmese people uses and there are several incidents about harassing and posting obscene things about public figures especially politicians. The quality of these incidents reduces after 4 or 5 initial offenders have to go to the court for trials and end up with jail time or other punishment. The reason behind this is that common people don‚Äôt know the constitutional law and telecommunication law that they violated. E.g.The following URL is the news about a burmese lady that post on facebook about Aung San Su Kyi and sentenced to jail for 6 months:https://www.rt.com/news/327262-myanmar-facebook-comment-jail/I often see people writing very vulgar comments that don‚Äôt even have personal impact. It can be seen by his/her relatives and friends that is very shameful and embarrassing. For some unknown reasons, I don‚Äôt understand why they seems very OK about that with their true PII. Lack of Social Media Ethics I guess.If you look at journalism world, the well-known journalists are also not ethical by writing things based on a reliable fact and information. E.g.There is an ongoing case about 2 journalists from one of the biggest media company whom defames the Yangon governor. https://cpj.org/2016/11/two-myanmar-journalists-arrested-on-criminal-defam.phpIMO, I don‚Äôt think the majority of Burmese people are definitely not ready to use the Internet for other purposes than social media and communication.2) Also, do you have any suggestions for people I should talk to‚Äìeither your friends or well-known tech people in Myanmar?The following list is local/foreign tech people and journalists that you can talk with;I deleted the list of people here for their privacy.Who are the most interesting people in tech in Myanmar?Peter Chou is a former CEO of HTC who was born in Myanmar and supports good burmese localization on HTC products. Apart from that, I don‚Äôt know and have much influence on other burmese tech people.What are the craziest stories involving how tech has changed life in Myanmar in the last few years? What are the craziest ways the sudden influx of mobile phones and internet has transformed Myanmar?  I‚Äôm really interested in personal stories that illustrate these larger trends.I was born in a small town and the first time I touched a computer is at Grade 7;12 or 13 years old. It was part of the school program of mid-school high scored students. The computer is Macintosh II that looks very much like CRT TV that my family owns. My first thought is like ‚Äúwhat is so special about this TV?‚Äù. The program is pretty boring that students are allowed to use mouse in turn to click the correct words according to the image on the screen.I was moved to the City at grade 10 and stayed with my uncle who is an architect that uses CAD tools for his job. I learned how to use computers properly and built an interest on IT. After high school, I studied Computer Science at University of Computer Studies Yangon at 2003. The price of mobile phone from MPT at that time is almost the same cost with a new motor bike. Only rich people can afford to own one. I don‚Äôt even own a computer until I turn to 21. My mom bought is for me after my first year at university which is even less than half the price of a GSM mobile phone. To make it clear,the handsets is nothing. A working sim card is the thing that expensive. (Thanks to the junta government.)My expose to internet is at 2004 or 2005. I asked a fellow classmate to teach me how to use internet and still remembers his face that express ‚Äúreally!?‚Äù. He creates this email account and show me Google. And he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. You can explore. Just don‚Äôt get broke by wasting too much time at the internet cafe‚Äô.‚Äù The speed is around 0.01 MBps and the gateway server stops working now and then. Home internet subscription was really expensive and it is still expensive now for middle class people.The boom of internet usage happens after the goverment opens the market for cooperate companies to invest. Telenor and Oreedoo gains market share from MPT that control telecom market. Every one can afford to own a mobile phone and telecommunication is much better. Some useless telecom government projects just ends up being a service nobody uses. E-telegram is a project I was part of the development team. The service is somehow userful back then but useless at this point.URL: http://www.etelegram.net.mm/3) What things do you think I should be paying attention to as I write this?  What might I overlook?This is difficult to say at this point. There are many things going wrong and I think you can cover as much aspects as you can. I have no idea about this.Second Q&amp;A1)I‚Äôd be interested in hearing more about what growing up in Myanmar was like for you and how you became interested in technology.  What was the village you grew up in like?  What was your experience of modern technology like there vs. what it was like once you moved to the city?   It seems like you first got interested in computers in the city.  Can you give me more details about the time you saw your uncle‚Äôs computer and got interested?  What captured your interest exactly? Pretend you‚Äôre telling me a story, so I understand exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time.The town I grew up is called ‚ÄúThanbyuzayat‚Äù. ‚ÄúZayat‚Äù is a free lodging place that travelers can sleep and ‚ÄúThanbyu‚Äù means tin material.  It‚Äôs a nice small town and well-known for Thailand-Myanmar Death Railway during WW II. Technology is limited to radio, cassette tapes, televisions and VCR sets back then. Black out is like all the time and the time you get an electricity is the time you enjoy your choice of entertainment. My family don‚Äôt have electricity generator because my mom thinks it‚Äôs a waste of money. One of the routine of my father is to carry 2 heavy car batteries to a charging station and wait for a day. We can have screen time the next day. I still remembers a funny story about my first World Cup at 1998. It is a final match and the battery run out of juice before the match finishes and we have to open the windows to listen from neighbors to know which team wins the cup. The first time I see a CD player is from my father‚Äôs friend visited from the city. He brought a walkman that I am like ‚ÄúWow!! This circle disk can skip a song in a sec. Not like the cassette tape player that takes forever‚Ä¶‚Äù. My elder brother is the one who introduces me to console gaming. It‚Äôs a gaming station with 1 single Nintendo console that kids are queuing to play. Later on, a business man opens a bigger one with several Nintendo consoles. That‚Äôs where I mostly spend my pocket money and weekends.When I moved to study at the city, the school is the same with a slightly different environment. My uncle home office is the place I spent all my summer break and weekends. He already know that I like to read books and have a curious mind on things based on my father stories of how I try to disassemble his cameras and PDA into pieces. My uncle introduces me with technical books and just let me do whatever I want with the PC after he explains basic knowledge of Windows 95 around 30 minutes or so. I am very excited that I have an access to the so-called computer. As a 15 years old, my major interest is games folder of course. My uncle is let me play games with a time limit and asks me to do some typing lessons. After I got familiar with the keyboard layout and basic OS, I open the applications I think interesting and play with it. The root of my interest on technology come from my curiosity of gadgets. I didn‚Äôt have any clear objective that I want to do this or that. I was just enjoyed using computers and I made a decision that my dream job is ‚Äúcomputer engineer‚Äù or any thing to do with computer.Lack of interest is one obvious problem of Burmese students due to the education system that don‚Äôt have activites for the students to explore things. 9 out of 10 students don‚Äôt know what they want to do when they grow up. School is just a place we go, sit, listen to teachers, do homeworks and pass exams. Not much activities expect the minister of Education wakes up with a program like ‚ÄúMultimedia Education‚Äù (that I mentioned previously). After the matriculation exam, the university you can enter depends on your scores on the exam. If you get high marks on the exam, students tend to enroll for medical school that is ‚Äúpopular education‚Äù at that time and it is still the same trend now. Every parents want their kids to become a doctor including mine. I just did ok at the matric exam to avoid the pressure from my parents and go to the computer college. There are even examples of famous people who spends 7 years in medical school and do something unrelated with medical field like a well-known,writer, Ju.2)  What was computer college like if all of the access to the internet was so restricted?Burmese education system focus on quantity rather than quality. The Computer Institution I studied is located at Yangon and there are around 2000-3,000 students at my first year. I am like ‚Äúdamn..so many people into IT major‚Äù. However, it found out that the majority of student are just joining the institute based on the limitation of high school matric exam score without much interest. I know so many people from this institution but not even 50% of them works in IT related businesses/career. Of course, we have a big-ass lab full with computers with no internet access. There is one lab class every week but students only go there to sign up attendance sheet to fulfill one of the stupid requirement of the program. The requirement is ‚Äúevery students require 75% attendance to sit a final examination‚Äù. Obviously,I didn‚Äôt learn anything inside the lab. The classroom is similar with high school. Text books and note taking with teachers trying their best to explain complicated. No computers involved. Some rich kids have phone that they play.Some courses are just funny and crazy like programming courses. Teachers are teaching on white board and students are looking at teachers writing some alien-sorta-look-like-English language. The same method applies for programming exam. We solves the program snippets on the paper. Debugging is not a thing.As for me, I relies on my English comprehension skill and try to read the text books by myself. I just really want to understand how things work. I met with some students who are also into IT and we shared about the concept and ideas outside the class. I graduated as one of the top 10 students after 3 years and continues a one year honours class because I don‚Äôt know what to do yet. During my honors year, I got a chance to participate ITU Youth Forum 2008 at Bangkok as Burmese representative. It just happens out of blue after the dean call out top 10 students from each years(2nd,3rd,honors and master) to write an essay. The essay is about ‚Äúthe idea to reduce the digital divide between rural and remote area‚Äù. The teacher said people can use any materials during the essay exam. I have no idea what the other students are looking at the book into. I wrote A4 paper contains few ideas. The university selects 2 male and 2 female students and the ITU selects 2 students. At the end, I got an email that says I was selected to attend with the attachment of air tickets. I called my parents and they are shocked with excitement.That is the event that change my thoughts and view of the world. I met with 2 people from every 50 Asia Pacific countries. After interacting with these people from different culture and background for a week, there are so many skills that I need to acquire to learn.3)  Can you tell me more about the E-telegram?  That seems sort of funny.After I graduated, I was trying to enroll at Singapore university for Master degree. It didn‚Äôt happen because I can‚Äôt afford the living expense and study cost. I joined a local software company as a web developer for 2-3 years. Most of the projects I worked at that company is government project and E-telegram is one of them. The objective of e-telegram is to send telegram to remote areas that don‚Äôt have an access to internet. For e.g. a sender sends a telegram from the web services and the message is transferred to the nearest telegram office with internet access. Afterwards,the message is printed out and send to the destination through as traditional telegram. It sounds like a good idea but very few people uses it back then. I think people prefers talking over the phone than a telegram.4)  And I‚Äôm curious, why did you leave Myanmar?  Did it have to do with wanting more access to technology?After working at Yangon around 3 years, I decided to go to Thailand for several reasons. First, I got a offer letter from No.1 public university in Thailand. Second,I still can work as a professional during my study.I works at the research lab during my study. Third, Thailand is affordable with good living standard and similar culture with my motherland. Technology is also more advanced than Myanmar and I don‚Äôt need to struggle a lot for a living. As for now, my current position is InfoSec Engineer and I am not sure there is a position in Myanmar if I want to go back and work. The newly formed government needs to create jobs to save ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù because the majority of IT people had been going abroad. The idea behind is that ‚Äúit‚Äôs the same job and responsibility. Why not going for a job with a better pay and a better life?‚Äù. The family we left also get benefits from our savings. it‚Äôs a win-win situation for everyone. The Burmese economy is not stable and the living expense of Yangon is higher than bangkok. The income of middle class and white collar job don‚Äôt have a positive balance with living expenses. a handful or rich people is getting richer and the rest of the public are just poor and poor. Thanks to the junta government for their outstanding regime! I hope a new government makes a positive change for the well-being of the Burmese citizen."

This post is just a quick guideline to setup tor network with proxy tool for any browsers on Debian Linux environment.This is a quick explanation of Tor and Proxy tool. Please google them for further details.Tor Relay Network &amp; ProxyTor,(The Onion Router) Network is a mechanism to relay to the top-level domain, .onion anonymously by hopping through worldwide network to conceal the source of the encrypted data packet. Basically, The purpose is to hide your network activities and to get access to the darknet.The easiest way to access to onion domains and use tor anonymous service is to download and install tor bundle browser.However,if you want tor network to enable for all our browsers, we can set up using additional proxy tools to create proxy chains and filter outbound network messages. Keep in mind that Tor is also a proxy and also Burped Proxy, Privoxy, or any other proxy tools can listen and forward messages from browsers to Tor.ConfigurationThis following note describes the way to setup tor with privoxy to forwards all browsing traffic to tor network. I believe it works for all debian system and Ubuntu based distros.# 1. Install Tor and Privoxysudo apt-get install tor privoxy# 2.

    "snippet": "Intro &amp; AimThis is a gist of tools and softwares that helps for the academic researchers to improve their productivity and organization. The tools are based on personal experience and inputs from the colleagues. Due to my Computer Science background, I like to explore software tools that can automate and make things easier without complication. I categorize the tools by similar product categories with brief explanation of what this tool can help you in the research process.Paperless literatureAt the early stage of research, we deal with tons of papers and articles. We print them out..note them and lose them somewhere in the stack of paper. Organizing the printed hard-copy is a time consuming task. What if we can‚Äôt find the statement from 1 paper and can‚Äôt find them in the stack of paper, it is really frustrating.Using paper organizer/reference manager is a working solution to solve this problem. (Saving pdf copies of them in a traditional method is ok but still not the optimal solution IMO.)Options are  Mendley  Endnote  ZoteroOne of these 3 solutions is the best reference manager available at this time of writing. It have several useful features such as annotating the reference,importing and exporting citation,and downloading files and meta directly from the web.1.Resources 2.Resources 3.ResourcesAnother task we do it time by time is searching keywords of the research interests to catch up the trend. For e.g., I search several databases of keywords (Browser Forensic, Digital Forensic,Private Browsing..) to read and review latest publications. There are no academic search engines that cover the entire published researches. wiki provides lists of academic databases for various disciplines.Some of my picks are Scopus by Elsevier, IEEExplore by IEEE, SpringerLink by Springer, CiteseerX by Penn State Uni and Google Scholar.Writing without pain in the neckI spent a lot of time on this part to discover the ultimate writing tool to write academic paper and articles effectively. Many people are satisfied with MS Office suite. Do writing on Word and draw stuffs on Visio and Excel to handle tabular numeric data. I prefer to avoid using MS Office because I don‚Äôt stuck in vendor lock-in. I use Google Docs for writing for my thesis documentation but it is still lack of some features that make the writing experience smooth and easy.IMO, Latex is painful to get started but it is the most convenient format to write academic articles. Why? Integration with bibliography, reference feature and the most valuable feature is publication templates. Overleaf is my platform of choice for writing latex. It it a web-based academic writing platform with version control and full support of Latex with choice of publisher templates. Gummiis a Latex tool I used for off-line writing.Other options are  Authorea  Sharelatex  GingkoBackup for the disasterEveryone knows there is a chance that you can lose your data by  Human error such as accidentally wiping out the project  Hardware fault  Disaster and theft  Other unexpected strange incidents like spilling coffee over the laptop‚Ä¶For these reasons, it is important to think of a fool-proof method to back up data safely on local and/or remote location. Cloud is a good solution and Google Drive, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive is the best solution out there. It‚Äôs wise to keep local backup on external HDD or just a thumb-drive. If you are familiar with version control systems, it‚Äôs also a good solution since it keeps a backup series of the project.Other useful toolsThere are also many tools you might need that depend on your project. The following are some of the tools I personally used for different purposes.Note-taking and draftingI prefer clean minimal note taking app like moo.do. Evernote is also a popular note taking app. If you wants a bit of formatting, try any markdown editor like stackedit.Online ReadingI like to highlight and read page directly at the page like similar reading experience from medium. There are several browser add-ons to achieve that and my favorite ones are Highly and Markticle.  Grammarly browser addons do several functions including highlight-dictionary that is very useful while reading.BookmarkingThere are many searching and saving resources throughout the research process.      Pocket is my personal favorite for one-clicking saving from your favourite browser with tags support.        Pearltrees provides organizing and collaborating by category of your preferences.        Saved uses a different apporach compared with other link management services by typing saved.io/ in front of URL to save the page.        Raindrop is for people who like to curate just a photo,video and content like Pinterest style.  ProductivityProductivity is something many people chasing for but only some get it to a certain level. Distraction is the main thing that slow down your productivity followed by interruption, laziness and lack of self-motivation and other emotional distress. Time tracking is one thing that most people do with scheduling and planning in many different methods and techniques. Pomodoro is the popular technique to focus on what you are doing and tracking the time with a short and long period break.Procrastinating needs to beat with scheduling and planning with to-do list and scrum method. There is one product that stand out by blending Pomodoro technique and To-Do list called Pomotodo and it works pretty well for me. Trello becomes a standard tool for scrum task and tracking the progress. As for serious time tracking, tools like Rescuetime works nicely with reporting on how much time you spend on which apps. Toggl is also a great time tracking platform but it‚Äôs not available for free.OutroI hope I help you on your search of tools and tips to improve your research process and I left off some topics like diagramming and statistics tools to limit the length of this blog. Have a good day and fight for science!"

    "snippet": "I am an expat living in Bangkok and rely on public transportation to avoid high traffic of Bangkok. I like to read/think and text during the daily commute to the office. As for commuting to a destination disconnected to train or bus, I have to use public taxi to get there. Lately, I‚Äôve been using Uber instead of public taxi service for these reasons:  Communication problem with taxi driver. Language barrier.  Tricky taxi driver driving around the unnecessary route.  Refusing to go to some high-traffic destination.  Comfort.  Safety.I ran into 2 blog entries that highlights some aspects about owning a car vs Uber or Lyft and decided to added some personal opinions. You can read the following entries to get some expert perspective and result of the research.  People in Los Angeles Are Getting Rid Of Their Cars  Uber vs Car OwnershipI never own a car and this is based on the experience sharing from friends who are driving with their personal cars. The following list shows the problem of owning/driving a car at BKK  Parking parking parking‚Ä¶  Traffic  Maintenance  Additional cost of car such as parking ticket, speeding tickets and accessoriesOf course! there are several advantages of owning a car. You don‚Äôt need to wait. Drive whatever you want. Don‚Äôt need to worry about bad driver. You can customize it the way you want. These are the advantages we can‚Äôt get from Uber or public taxi. I have bad experience with some Uber driver such as awful navigation issue, small and uncomfortable car, unreliable driver and so on.Apart from the cost efficiency point of view, it is more of personal preference and people who like to drive continues driving with the known trade-offs of driving. The previously mentioned buzzfeed blog said ‚Äúowning a car will become a thing of the past.‚Äù but it‚Äôs a difficult thing to say now. I don‚Äôt like to drive but most of my friends like to drive. Owning a car means a social status among the community and current generation‚Äôs teenagers and young adults still love to drive.Until the tax, energy and price tag of a car is affordable, driving craze will continue driving and people like me will keep using car services. As simple as that‚Ä¶"

    "snippet": "I suggests you to read this essay [on cybersecurity and being targeted](http://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/on-cybersecurity-and-being-targeted) before continuing this entry.The cyber-attacks are getting more focus and intelligent than ever. The attackers have specific objectives, methodologies and strategies to achieve their goals with high persistence. So, Human is the major vulnerable point in organization security and by strengthening your personal security, you can avoid from being a poential vulnerable target. Traditional username/password is not a strong and secure authentication method anymore, which is the reason why many online services are exercising multi-factor authentication MFA and 2FA via Github. This blog entry is to explain a gentle introduction of multi-factor authentication in a simple and uncomplicated manner for general public.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)This is not a new concept for everyone. If padlock is not secure enough, we add a new layer of security with access card, home security system or an extra padlock to tighten the security. Withdrawing cash from ATM machine requires PIN number (something you know) and ATM Card(Something you have).MFA contains at least 2 of the following authentication mechanisms to get access to a certain system which are  Knowledge (something you know; passwords,PIN)  Possession (something you have; Mobile Phone, Access Card, Contact Card,Tokens)  Inherence (something you are; Fingerprint, Iris, Face, Voice)2nd Factor Authentication (2FA)At this time, the most popular and practical 2FA authentication method includes user‚Äôs mobile device by sending SMS of the verification code or Authentication app that generate 6 digit tokens. I personally prefer authentication app since it‚Äôs a bit more convenient than SMS messages. Another reason is that an attacker can exploit your SIM card or simply call the service provider for a new sim card. Authenticator app like Lastpass Authenticator generates token in a timely manner and also have a single-tap login feature.IMO, FIDO Protocols presents reliable authentication option but it needs additional device or device with biometric modalities support. At this time of writing, 2FA is still the best authentication option for the majority of on-line web services with some painful drawbacks. 2FA shows a list of websites that supports 2FA authentication options.The following section is a generic starter guideline to improve the security of online services:1. Use Password Managerit‚Äôs better than same passwords for all websites. Use 1 hardcore strong master password with high diversity and combination. It improves your productivity by autofilling the username and passwords.Services: Lastpass, Dashlane, LogmeOnce, Keeper, StickyPassword2. Turn on 2FA authentication OptionI know it is tedious and time consuming but it‚Äôs better than exploiting your data to the attackers‚Äô hands.So, turn on 2FA authentication via email, SMS, or Phone Call.3. Use 2FA authenticator app (Softtoken)SoftToken vs SMS is a controversial topic among security experts and I prefer Softtoken app rather than SMS 2FA option. It‚Äôs more convenient(QR Code Scan), No additional cost but to keep in mind that it‚Äôs also an application that can be compromised by malwares to transmit TOTP to elsewhere.Services: RSA SecurID Software Token, Lastpass Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator4. Spend few dollars on Hardware tokens/USB Security KeysHardware tokens are around for a while and it provide stronger security than SMS but it‚Äôs not necessary and provided by most of the online services. FIDO USB Security Key (USB Dongles) such as Yubikey are more practical for daily basis usage of online web services. The leading online company such as Google, Github, and Dropbox are started to adopt U2F options for the system. These tiny keys don‚Äôt need any drivers and can use it directly at any Operating System platforms with ease. The USB keys are also pretty robust and can attach it with your physical keys. Check DongleAuth to see which sites are supporting USB Security Keys.5. Stay tune for security trends and best practicesKnowledge plays a critical role in securing your personal data and preventing the potential attacks. Follow the InfoSec latest news of security experts from the mainstream media channels like twitter and learn what to yay and nay."

Due to the requirement of Work place network restrictions and It‚Äôs working well but I believe it‚Äôs still missing several useful features compared with Linux DE/WM like Ubuntu Unity, Mate or Cinnamon. The entry is not about what Windows 10 Multitasking features are. It‚Äôs about what are missing at Windows 10. You can find many blog entries that talk about capabilities of Windows 10 multi-tasking. Here is a few of them:  Multitasking by msdn  6 multitasking tips to be more productive on Windows 10  Windows 10 Multitasking Features DemoSwitching apps among WorkspacesThis is one of the features I use a lot while I am working with several apps running.I like to organize the apps by switching to another workspace and categorize it logically. The only way to do at Windows 10 is by pressing ‚ÄúWin+Tab‚Äù and dragging the apps into the desired workspace. It might be better if I can just press the shortcut to move the active app to another workspace.Hot CornerThere is no hot corner feature on Windows 10. Unity or Cinnamon(my favorite DE) have an option to customize the actions for each corners of the screen such as ‚ÄúShowing Desktop‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpreading out Apps‚Äù and ‚ÄúShowing the Workspace Layouts‚Äù. It saves time and easy to jump to another workspace.No customizationThere is no customization for keyboard shortcuts and it fails me since I uses both Linux and Windows and I would like to use the same key mappings across these two platforms. My muscle memory is confused every time I switch from one platform to another one.I hope that MS team will implement these features in upcoming patches that can improve the user experience and productivity.

    "snippet": "What‚Äôs wrong with passwords?Every one might agrees that passwords are difficult. They can be forgotten. They are easy to be revealed by phishing, key-logging and other social engineering attacks. Strong passwords need to have many factors and complex combination to avoid brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks and the main problem is people tends to use easy to get personal information as passwords instead of high complexity passwords that take years of enumeration time to decrypt it.Traditional authentication process is not reliable anymore and 2nd factor authentication (2FA) and multi-step authentication become a critical protocol to escalate the privacy of user data and organization data. However, 2FA (Tokens, SMS, OTP) protocols are expensive and/or with low User experience and also other protocol specific issues.What is FIDO ?To improve the user experience and increase the privacy level and protection level of user data, a new standard is introduced called Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) authentication standard which contains 2 protocols;  Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) &amp; Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). FIDO Alliance is formed by 3 technology and security leaders: Yubico, Google, Paypal, MasterCard &amp; Visa. Let‚Äôs go to the next section to see what these protocols can do and how it can overcome the issues of 2FA protocols.What FIDO protocols can do?UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) ProtocolUAF protocols offer password-less experience to the user by using biometric modalities and USB security key as an easy to use authentication method for web and mobile applications. Compared with traditional authentication protocol, UAF uses biometric multi-authentication through biometric software/hardware devices to log in to the system. The following demo video shows how UAF protocol uses TouchID to log in to the website in few seconds. The advantages over the U2F protocols is that it can avoid social engineering and phishing attacks and other data tampering attacks. The limitation at this time of writing is the support of mobile devices that supports fingerprint scanner and also adoption of the protocol in the majority of the applications. The overview and detailed specifications of the protocol can be found at FIDO Alliance Specifications Overview.UAF Biometric Login DemoU2F (Universal 2nd Factor) ProtocolU2F is multi-factor authentication protocol for existing online applications by adding a strong 2nd factor authentication to strengthen it. The progress of U2F &amp; other 2FA adoption can be seen at dongleauth. The user experience of U2F is improved compared with other 2FA protocols because of U2F supported USB key-chains are durable, ready to use and prevent phishing attacks. Google U2F:Overview is a quick review of U2F protocol presentation slide from Google. It highlights the advantages of U2F protocol over traditional 2FA protocols such as SMS,OTP and Software/Hardware tokens. The video clips shows the demo of U2F log-in procedure using Hypr-3 U2F Bluetooth Dongle.HYPR Biometric FIDO U2F and OTP TokenThoughts and ProgressFIDO Protocols are still in the early stage but it shows potential to solve security issues for data-sensitive applications,especially in financial domain. There are several open-source implementation of the protocol that can be a starting point for implementors and developers;  eBay Implementation of UAF Server/Client demo  Google U2F Reference Implementation  An open-source FIDO Certified U2F server  Yubico Python U2F Server Implementation  Yubico Python U2F Host Implementation"

    "snippet": "Back to previous blog post on the issues with Burmese digital writing fonts standard, people are still pointing fingers and a fool-proof solution is far away to settle on either Zawgyi or else. A friend shares me a Facebook post about a new font, Pyidaungsu Zaw Decode, that created by a researcher who is working at Myanmar Unicode &amp; NLP Research Center. The font promises to render both Unicode and Zawgyi fonts and it seems to have a high potential to tackle the issue. The following is download URLs for True Type font and Android APK executables.  TFF  APKThis blog is to review and evaluate the potential of this font whether it can solve this issue. I am aware that it‚Äôs still in production stage which might encounters font rendering issue.InstallationInstalling TTF font can be done easily with default font installer of the targeted platform (Windows,Mac &amp; Linux distros). However, it is a bit tedious for Android system. First of all, the phone needs to have a root privilege to change default system font. The second consideration is to switch font after installing the APK file using Android Font changer app. I use iFont that works fine and can restore to Factory Font with just a click. Go to MyInstall for custom installation of ZawDecode Font and the app restarts the system to switch to the new font.Is it work?I uses the web page that contains first section for Zawgyi font and second section for Unicode font to evaluate the correctness of rendering both Zawgyi and Unicode font. The web page shows that Zawgyi font rendering is not 100% correct but Unicode rendering is almost perfect with some incorrect rendering, which can be seen at the below figure. Typing Burmese with this font also gives an incorrect output with common Burmese android keyboards like FrozenKeyboard 2.A question rises that this point is that ‚ÄúDoes this font needs a specific supported keyboard to type either Zawgyi or Unicode?‚Äù. Another question that needs to clarify is that ‚ÄúIs it only to decode either Zawgyi or Unicode without consideration of writing/typing?‚ÄùI am aware that this is still in the early stage of development and the development teams can fix these issues to make it compatible with both Zawgyi and Unicode in the near future. I am just an enthusiast to solve this issue in the near future because it can drag down the advancement of technology in most aspects especially in digitalization and telecommunication."

    "snippet": "IntroductoryThe purpose of this article is to list down books and learning resources for Digital Forensic self-learners and new comers. When I was started learning about fundamentals and principles of Digital Forensic and Incident Response, I had a hard time looking for the starting point. Also, most of the learning tutorials and training courses are not free. This is my collection of resources for newcomers to Digital Forensic research area.Publication JournalThanks to the Digital Investigation Journal from Elsevier publication. I got a hand on high quality research papers and trend on Digital Forensic. The other journals that focus on DFIR are  IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security  International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics  International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics   International Journal of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics  The International Journal of Forensic Computer Science  International Journal of Information and Computer Security  Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law  Journal of Information Security and ApplicationBooksAs for the books, This is the books I discovered and presented by categories. Of course, it is not necessary to read all the books. You can justify and focus on the books which provides the skills and knowledge you requires. As for the beginner, It is a good idea to start picking a book or two of fundamental and basic concepts of DF before continuing to a platform specific books. In this way, it will give you some foundation and formal knowledge required.Fundamental Principles &amp; Concepts  The Basics of Digital Forensics: The Primer for Getting Started in Digital Forensics  The Best Damn Cybercrime and Digital Forensics Book Period   Handbook of Digital Forensics and Investigation  Digital Forensic with open source tools  Investigating Internet Crimes: An Introduction to Solving Crimes in Cyberspace Procedures and Forensic Models  Digital Forensics Processing and Procedures  Digital Forensics: Threatscape and Best Practices  Digital Forensic TriageSpecific Platform/Methodology  Operating System Forensic  Windows Forensic Analysis  Linux Forensic  Android Forensic  iPhone and iOS Forensic  Digital Forensics for Network, Internet, and Cloud Computing  Virtualization and Forensics: A Digital Forensic Investigator‚Äôs Guide to Virtual Environments  Windows Registry Forensic  Big Data Forensics: Learning Hadoop Investigations  Cloud Storage ForensicMalware Forensics  Malware Forensics Field Guide for Linux Systems  Malware Forensics Field Guide for Windows SystemsPython for Forensics  Python Forensics: A workbench for inventing and sharing digital forensic technology   Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers  Mastering Python ForensicsMemory Forensic  The Art of Memory ForensicBlogs &amp; TutorialsExcept fellow twitter DFIR people and Linkedin groups, I don‚Äôt read any particular blogs that focus about current trends and issues on Digital Forensic. The entry from Digital Forensic Association and also Forensic Focus selected 5 top DF blogs.As for tutorials, I believe there are many paid training programs available for every aspects of Digital Forensic field. I recommend Cybray for computer security and forensic free programs and it‚Äôs also a network of fellow security practitioners. For beginners with A+ and Security+ knowledge, go for Computer Hacking Forensic Analysis course.That‚Äôs for now.I will update this blog post time by time based on my discovery on Digital Forensic."

    "snippet": "Miniature CalendarThis mini-project started from another design project called Miniature Calendar. It‚Äôs a beautiful creative project, which creates real world scenes with small scaled objects. The author of the project posts 1 creative idea per day in a chronological order. The only way to get access and acquire these images is by visiting project social media pages or the project official website.I was just thinking a way to download these photos into my local image repository and enjoy as wallpaper and so on. So, why not analyze the site structure and try to scrap these images for inspiration. I think the author might not mind for personal use of these images since these images have been sharing across the social medias.Web Scraping 101After researching about half an hour, I decided to use two major Python libraries for this mini-projects which are BeautifulSoup and urllib2. These two libraries become a de-facto standard for web scraping with Python. I also decided to use argparse library to handle arguments to download images for today or images of the past whole month.The following listing is sort of a breakdown plan for to achieve this web scrapper:  Analyze website information structure.  Extract the images from the server through ‚Äúsrc‚Äù of HTML img tags.  Create a function to ask,store and retrieve folder path to store the images.  Use argument parser to ask user to download today image or images from the entire past month.  Some error handling.The final python script of this project can be see at scrap_miniature.What are we looking for?The first thing to do it to learn a bit about these 2 Python libraries; BeautifulSoup and urllib2. The documentations are pretty straightforward to start working on it. I browse the website and use Chrome developer tools to examine the location of the img tag. At the end of this process, I implemented a Python function to download images from the website. Urllib2 opens URLs and retrieve HTML content which is parsed with bs4 to lxml format. HTML elements can be extracted by using class name, attributes and also by HTML tags. In this case, I extract the img tags with attribute of height to 1080. Finally, the image path is downloaded with ‚Äòurlretrieve‚Äô function of urllib.# function that scrap src of imagesdef get_miniature(url,filename):    try:        html = urlopen(url).read()        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"lxml\")        outpath = os.path.join(out_folder, filename)        # This is the html component we are looking for        # &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8908\" height=\"1080\" src=\"http://miniature-calendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/160202tue.jpg\" title=\"Sand shot\" width=\"1080\"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            img = soup.find(attrs={\"height\" : \"1080\"})            print img[\"src\"]+ \" is downloading...\"        urlretrieve(img[\"src\"], outpath)    except:        print \"URL don't exist..skip!\"Download imagesTwo functions are created to download images by today time and also loop for the whole month and download in a single batch. Since the image path is in timestamp format(yymmdd), it is possible to implement the path by manipulating Python datetime object.#download today imagedef daily():            today = str(time.strftime(\"%y%m%d\",local))     absurl = baseurl+today     # concat baseURL with yymmmdd folderr today    file_ = today+\"_min.jpg\"        get_miniature(absurl,file_)    # download photos of the whole month def monthly(yy,mm):    # get folder structure like http://miniature-calendar.com/160126/ (baseurl/yymmdd/)    # iterate for whole month    for i in range(0,calendar.monthrange(yy,mm)[1]):        day = str(yy)+str(format(mm,'02'))+str(format(i+1,'02'))        absurl = baseurl+day    # concat baseURL with yymmdd and each days in month        file_ = day+\"_min.jpg\"                get_miniature(absurl,file_)Default Download LocationAlso, it might be nice to have a feature to select a location to download the images. 3 functions are implemented to ask the user preference and save it to a flat file at home directory. Later on,the script will refer the flat file,‚Äù.outpath‚Äù,as the path to save images. To change the path by simply removing the file and run the program again.#create folder and write file path to flat filedef mkdir_(path):    out_file = open(\".outpath\",'w')    if (os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser(path))):        print \"Folder already exists\"        out_file.write(os.path.expanduser(path))    else:           os.mkdir(os.path.expanduser(path))        out_file.write(os.path.expanduser(path))    out_file.close()# ask user the file pathdef out_path():        print \"folder path to download images (default:~/Downloads/miniature-calendar/)\"    file_dir = raw_input(\"&gt; \")        if file_dir == \"\":        mkdir_(\"~/Downloads/miniature-calendar/\")            else:        mkdir_(file_dir)                # read and validate output file locationdef read_file_path():    outpathfile = open(os.path.expanduser(\".outpath\"), 'r')    file_dir = outpathfile.read()    if (os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser(file_dir))):            return file_dir    else:        print \"Invalid file path!\"        print \"Folder created at this path: \"+ os.path.expanduser(file_dir)        os.mkdir(os.path.expanduser(file_dir))        return file_dirArgument Parser for better interactionArgparse is a Python module that can handle program argument nicely. For this script, it accepts 2 optional arguments to download images daily or monthly.def ParseCommandLine():    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser('Download miniature-calendar images.[\"-d\" for today photo..\"-m mmyy\" to archive photos of entire month.]')    parser.add_argument('-d','--daily',action=\"store_true\", help='Download today image')    parser.add_argument('-m','--monthly', help='Download for the whole month (mmyy) e.g. \"0216\" for February 2016')        theArgs = parser.parse_args()    return theArgsdef main(args):    out_folder = read_file_path()    if args.daily:                    print \"Today image is downloading to \" + out_folder        daily()        print \".........Done.........\"    elif args.monthly:                    if len(args.monthly) &lt;4:            print \"pls make sure you input is in this format:mmyy\"        else:            mm = int(args.monthly[0]+args.monthly[1])            yy = int(args.monthly[2]+args.monthly[3])            print \"Images are downloading to \" + out_folder            monthly(yy,mm)            print \".........Done.........\"    else:        print \"try again with -h.\"if __name__ == \"__main__\":        # check output filepath    if os.path.isfile(os.path.expanduser(\".outpath\")) is False:        out_path()        print \"pls run the program again...\"    else:        args = ParseCommandLine()                main(args)UsageA short usage suggestion can be found at Github Repo."

    "snippet": "What is CloudRead ChomeOS?At this point, I belive you heard a thing or two about ChromeOS or Chromebook. It‚Äôs a lightweight operating system from Google that centered on Chrome browser with web apps. Recently, a company called neverware releases CloudReady ChromeOS based on Google Chrominum OS project. The difference with existing ChromeOS alternatives such as Cr OS is that CloudReady ChromeOS is not based on Linux distro with ChromeOS like WM/DE.InstallationInstallation is pretty straightforward and this  manual provides detailed options. I prepared bootable media with my 16GB kingston thumb-drive using Chrome Recover Tools. It took around  10-15 minutes to prepare the bootable media. After that, reboot and switch boot device to thumb-drive and the CloudReady ChromeOS is ready to roll.First ImpressionsEverthing works pretty smooth with my Asus K45V laptop and Dell Inspiron-3847. Sound, Wifi and bluetooth are working well. Both PCs run on Intel architecture and for ARM architecture, it is still need to research and test out to find out the poential issues. After signed in with Google account, it started syncing my Chrome preferences, web apps and plug-ins within a couple minutes. My thumb-drive is pretty slow and I believe that data I/O will be a lot better for USB 3.0 thumb-drive.If the user like to install on HDD of the system, it provides 2 options; standalone installation and dual-boot installation. Standalone installation wipes out the entire harddisk and install CloudReady ChromeOS. As for dual-boot installation, it only works for PC with windows operating system with UEFI boot mode. My Asus laptop has 3 OS installed; Win 10, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Kali Linux. The attempt to install ends up with an error message. So, there is no option for Linux users to side-boot this OS. Check this dual-boot requirement page to see detailed instructions.Reasons to tryThis is good for users who are thinking about buying chromebook as secondary PC. You can evaluate the capability of OS and to decide whether it can fulfill your needs. Also, it is the best option for people who own aged system with low performance. Users who tried to install crouton have issues but 1 user said there is a way to solve it. Dennis Lockhart compiles crouton to work well with Chrominum OS which I will give a try soon. If it‚Äôs working nicely with crouton, this OS gonna be a perfect alternative of chromeOS.Room for improvementsThe following listing is issues that need to improve for Cloudready beta version 4.5:  Shutting down is slow and not responsive. The screen turns black and gives no output of the process.  It needs advanced users option to dual-boot this OS along side with other operating system.  Supports of crouton for PCs with hardware capability of running Linux apps.That‚Äôs it for now. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you should try this OS as a pocket personal OS or a primary OS for your old legacy PC.

Look for ‚ÄúMaterial design in the browser‚Äôs top chrome‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúMaterial‚Äù from dropdown list.        Look for ‚ÄúEnable Material Design downloads‚Äù and enable to change downloads page to MD UI.        Look for ‚ÄúEnable material UI for PDF‚Äù and enable it to change PDF viewer to MD UI.  Material settings page is enable by default and it can be viewed by ‚Äúchrome://md-settings/‚Äù. However, some functions are not working fully yet.I leave out screen shots for your excitement!Cheers!"

    "snippet": "I‚Äôve been using bash as primary shell since I started using Linux. It‚Äôs ok. Don‚Äôt bother looking for a better solution until I ran into this blog post about My favourite zsh features. TLDR people? Watch this Getting Started with ZSH (and oh my zshell) on Ubuntu from the same author of the blog post.It seems pretty good for interactive tasks and that auto completion feature is a dope. So,I decided to give a try.InstallationFor Debian system, just install it with aptitude tool bysudo apt-get install zshDetails of installing zsh can be seen at Installing ZSH.To replace the default shell to zsh, there are several ways to do it. However, I recommend installing oh-my-zsh and switching shell is done automatically.Oh-my-zshoh-my-zsh is an extension of zsh shell, which provides themes and plug-ins.InstallationIt can be installed using wget or curl bysh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"ORsh -c \"$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)\"If you encounter an authentication problem, it can be solved by downloading the install.sh file first and install it manually.FeaturesSo far, it‚Äôs quite similar to bash with additional features. It‚Äôs quite easy to adapt for bash users.For coders, I think zsh is a better option than bash. Check out this LevelTutsPlus youtube clip about how themes and plug-ins can help developers to aid at cmd tasks.From my a week long experience with zsh, The following points can be made:  It‚Äôs fancy and looks better than bash.  plug-ins are helpful but too much plug-ins make the shell slow down.  Developer related plug-ins are really intuitive and working nicely.  Error prompting and giving feedbacks and predicted actions make it friendly.  Opening files and some actions are slightly slower than bash. It might be the drawbacks of oh-my-zsh plug-ins.  I am still exploring the usage of zsh features from this Zsh features.So, try it and I kinda believe that you will fall in love with it in no time.Cheers!Additional reading:  Unix Shells   Better zsh with Prezto"

    "snippet": "  This is just a thought on maintaining source code on local system about the easiest and the most convenient way to avoid repetitive process.Code in CloudAs for projects working in several different computer,I think the best way to control version of the source code is to upload to cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox and so on. It‚Äôs working quite well for small to mid-size projects.For large scale projects, storage size might be a problem. The purpose of keeping inside cloud storage syncs the whole directory across your work and home PC. It skips the step of pulling the repo and merging since .git folder is syncing. It is also become automatic backup plan since files are syncing at cloud storage. As for security, it is suitable for open-source project but it might need to perform security measure for close-source projects.Auto-commit the projectAs for committing the project, it can semi-automate with a simple bash script like this:#! /bin/bash\tgit pullgit add -Agit commit -m $1git push origin masterAfter that, it is possible to commit by providing commit message as argument. Username and password might be necessary to provide according to your git settings on the system. Make sure to write .gitignore file to avoid backuping unnecessary files and sensitive information.If you want a weekly backup of the project folder on Linux system, create a crontab to do the routine jobs for you. If you don‚Äôt know about crontab, it‚Äôs easy and worth to learn it."

    "snippet": "December is a time you regret things you want to do, but you fail. And it‚Äôs also a moment you try to plan whether it‚Äôs realistic or not. One of the things I did for few years is listing books to read at upcoming year. It‚Äôs more like making the announcement for my commitment.There are 3 types of books I love to read; Non-fiction with technical content, humor and satire books and technical books. The following listing is a list of books I picked to read at upcoming year with recommendations from friends and goodreads.com.CryptoIt‚Äôs one of the IT nonfiction books from Steven Levy and I believe this book tells a story about cryptography, hacking and revolution of hackers. He published several books and the next one I am planning to read is ‚ÄúIn The Plex‚Äù.The Naked FutureThis book views on the perspective of evolution of technology and its affect on society. From the skimming of first chapter, it seems that the book mainly focus on big data.Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of AnonymousIf you are familiar with phrases like darknet, onion network, hacking activism and Anonymous, this is a book to know more about this secret organization that fighting their belief by announcing as cyberwar.Look Evelyn, Duck Dynasty Wiper Blades. We Should Get Them.: A Collection Of New EssaysThe third book from my favorite satire, David Throne and I don‚Äôt know what to expect from this one but believe it will be good like previous two. Check out his blog:27b/6 for a taste of his comedy.The Hitchhiker‚Äôs guide to galaxyI know this classic sci-fi comedy for a while but don‚Äôt have a chance to read it. Finally,I decided to put this one for 2016.Modern RomanceI like the stand-up comedy of this Indian dude and from the tagline, I believe this book is about his ideology on modern relationship. Another fun read,I hope!F*ck FeelingsYes..People are messy. They don‚Äôt listen to you. But machine does.. People are not logical. They are abstract..but we have to deal with them throughout their life. I hope this book will guide me some tips and tweaks to handle people.The Maker‚Äôs Guide to the Zombie ApocalypseYes. I have a thing about zombies and this is like a really good idea to learn building tools and gadget with a story line of zombie apocalypse. Just order Ardunio board and Raspberry Pi and there are lots of things to start some exciting projects.Linux BibleI would be lying If I said I read the entire book cover to cover. This is a tome of Linux and I will pick few chapters I think I should know.Network ForensicI am not a network guy and my knowledge on it is kind of limited. To get a grasp about forensic point of view on network, I think this is one promising to start with.Currently ReadingSmarter than you thinkThis is a book about technology and how it is changing human mind, memory and life in general. So far, I learn about a good explanation of AI and Chess and learning how human mind works. This book leave questions and curiosity for the readers.The Best Damn Cybercrime and Digital Forensics Book PeriodA good   book to dig into Digital Forensic concepts and procedure with details.Books read in 2015At the end of 2014, I wrote a blog post about list of books to read within 2014. I finished some of them and I added more books and swap some out from the list. As for 2015, my life is full with work, thesis writing and can‚Äôt spend much time reading books. However,I finished reading few books and let do a quick review on them.Being GeekThis is a must read book for software developers and programmers who needs tips and guidances about career, development and so on. It is well organized and easy to follow.Handbook of Digital Forensics and InvestigationAs for formal knowledge about basic principles of Digital Forensic, this is a good starter point to learn fundamental concept about Digital Forensic.Art of Memory Analysis‚ÄúArt of Memory Analysis‚Äù written by Volatility core developers. I read this book as a reference on my thesis writing for Memory analysis concepts and principles and I believe this is the best one at this time of writing.Linux Annoyances for GeeksAnother one is the book I forced myself to read. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúLinux Annoyances for Geeks‚Äù. For a deep understanding of Linux Operating system, this is one book to skim.Me Talk Pretty One DayI like reading humour and  is ‚ÄúMe Talk Pretty One Day‚Äù by David Sedaris. After David Thorne, I found this guy full with humours and sarcastic thoughts. If you like reading comedy book about life in general, check books from this guy.Dad Is FatAnother guy is also hilarious in his own way. I like his stand-up comedy and also his writing. The Zombie Survival GuideI still don‚Äôt know why I enjoy this book. Animations are awesome and it gives strange thoughts and idea about the situation of zombie apocalypse."

    "snippet": "Everyone knows Bruce Lee. He is a martial arts master, a movie star,and a student of Yip-man and more. As for an ordinary Asian dude, I wanna be like Bruce Lee when I was young. I wanna be a bad-ass like him. Nothing more than that‚Ä¶But after reading a brief biography about him, it seems that he is more than what I know when I was young. He studies philosophy and even writes poetry. The following quotes are some extracts of his belief and thoughts on life, learning and working.10,000 Kicks  I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.As for a coder and technical guy, I take it into ways that I can familiar with. From this quote, I have two ideas related with software development.There are two types of coder; ones who plan, code, run and debug it after a milestone and ones who debug and test at small snippets. I am second type of coders who code,test and repeat the process. In this way, I believe ‚Äúlosing your mind in a pile of bugs‚Äù is reduced to a certain extent.Another aspect of categorizing technician and coder is by working and learning behavior; ‚Äúspecialist or generalist?‚Äù. A specialist knows few things into a deep level of understanding. A generalist can capable of working with various technology and platform but knowledge on these subjects are limited. The first type of person is who knows a single powerful kick and the second type of guy is more like a person who can kick 10,000 different ways. In IT world, it‚Äôs a controversial issue to judge whether one is better than another. Due to dynamic nature of the field, technology is evolving and a specialist needs to catch up and have to learn new things. As for generalists, it is still important to understand matter to a practical level. Knowing little is harmful than knowing nothing.Blow punches or Kicks  Take things as they are. Punch when you have to punch. Kick when you have to kick.This is also a nice practical thought on how to plan and get things done. Research &amp; evaluation is 2 important procedure to consider when you are initiating for a new project. There are many things to evaluate such as ‚Äúwhich programming language to work with?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat kind of development methodology to exercise?‚Äù, ‚ÄúTools, Frameworks and necessary technology for the project?‚Äù and so on. It is important to research and evaluate to get things done productively. Everyone wants an axe to cut a tree rather than a knife, but it‚Äôs infeasible to cut an apple with axe.Lost in a forest of thoughts  If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you‚Äôll never get it done.A frequent advice you might hear from experienced coder is that ‚Äútake a short break frequently‚Äù. Programmers are like artists or musicians. They need to get into the ‚Äúzone‚Äù to craft things. For me, I am not working very well in the distracted environment and worrying about else. I really need to have a relaxed mind and environment to code and I believe it‚Äôs common among programmers. Forcing yourself to solve a bug for an hour gonna make you to oversee the real problem.Many problems are solved while you are not actually not thinking about it. Just skip it and work on another thing.Just take a coffee break to cool down your brain.To recap, it can be seen that he is a practical man with simple ideas to achieve things.Learn, apply and achieve by working smart and hard.Get an idea, stop daydream and start execute it. Like Shia Labeouf said"

The guy who magically upgrades latest Android version to super old phone handset  The guy who is on most Internet services and still finding out new products  The guy who really excited to talk about technical things at any situation  Some friends who do business don‚Äôt understand why I choose to do this pathetic jobI think‚Ä¶  I don‚Äôt know anything in details and throughly  I am fucking lazy to make codes prettier  ‚Äúnew ideas‚Äù written done in my notebook never become real products  Boss and managers don‚Äôt understand me  I don‚Äôt understand myself too"

    "snippet": "Updated as of 2022  The issue is resolved at 2019 with country wide effort to adopt Unicode font in mobile devices and in computerized system.TL;DR  This is ad hoc review and propaganda about incompatibility issue between Unicode fonts and non-Unicode fonts of Myanmar language. Instead of creating ‚Äúquick fixes‚Äù to make these fonts compatible for short-term periods, this article is trying to propose methods to solve this problem for long-term benefits.Artificial Language vs Natural LanguageFor computer systems and digital communication medium, there are 2 types of language. Artificial language is to implement and to create communication between human to machines. Natural language is the medium for human to human communication. The size and structure of artificial language and formal language are limited. For natural and constructed language, the complexity of syntax, rules, and structure is complex and it is out of the structure and pattern at some parts. To standardize and meet consistency at digital communication, it is necessary to set up a standard for natural language.To solve this solution, there are characters encoding and decoding standards to blend in natural languages nicely with artificial ones. Unicode is the standard you can find in modern operating systems and ASCII is another system that uses legacy operating systems such as Windows 95 and 98. For more about character encoding history, you can look at Character encoding-wiki.Unicode  Unicode provides a unique number for every character,no matter what the platform,no matter what the program,no matter what the language.That is the motto of Unicode. The improvement of Unicode standards and the reason behind all major Operating Systems use this characters encoding system is because it provides enough for all types of written words and also special characters. That‚Äôs one weakness of ASCII which is only suitable English language and provides only 128 characters.The latest version of Unicode is version 8.0 and it released at June 2015, even includes characters for emoji. For a specific language, Unicode provides technical specification and character mappings for all languages. It makes life easy for fonts creators. So, if a font followed standards and characters mapping of Unicode, it is compatible to install multiple typefaces within a system. So..what is the problem?Myanmar language &amp; characters encoding historyAt bloom of web 2.0, a local software provider from Myanmar introduces a font called ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù to use as computerized systems such as Windows applications and web applications. The font implementation relies on Windows Uniscribe engine and at that time, there is no problem since the majority of computer users are on Windows operating system and the internet is an invisible thing in the textbook. The problem with ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font is that it‚Äôs partially followed Unicode standards with many overlapping characters (figures at the end of this paragraph). It becomes a national IT problem and developers of Zawgyi font after 100% Unicode standard fonts are introduced.So, the solution is simple I thought at first. Just use the fonts that follow the Unicode encoding standards. In reality, it is complicated since many systems and users are familiar with ‚Äúzawgyi‚Äù font and they don‚Äôt see a problem such as system localization and incompatibility between Unicode fonts ad ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font. The problem becomes clear after Windows 8, OSX Lion, and mobile operating systems. OSX Lion and Windows 8 supports Myanmar language as input language and followed ‚ÄúMyanmar 3‚Äù font character mappings. ‚ÄúMyanmar 3‚Äù font is the font proposed at Unicode consortium and it becomes a standard model and all Unicode compliant Myanmar fonts need to look at ‚ÄúMyanmar 3‚Äù font.Unicode characters mappingZawgyi font characters mappingAt this time of writing, there are several Myanmar Unicode fonts developed such as Myanmar 3, Paduk, Tharlon and so on. In my Debian system and android 5.0, Paduak and tharlon are adapted as system language fonts. Padauk, Unicode version 6.0 compliant font, uses Graphite package instead of unscribe engine and I can‚Äôt find technical information about Tharlon. A technical white paper about Graphite engine can be seen at Graphite: Smart-font technology to bridge the digital divide. So, you might think there are solutions available and what seems to be the problem at this point. Please bear with me to next section.Solution 1.0, Solution 2.0 ‚Ä¶Developers from different platforms are implementing various mechanisms to make a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù to solve this problem such as browser plugins, mobile applications and so on. Replacing ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font with system default Myanmar locale fonts and implementing binary executables to automate the whole process. In my opinion, these solutions are the unnecessary solutions that only works temporarily. For mobile platform, android and iOS releases a new version almost once a year and it is not convenient for developers to implement a new ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù and also end-users have to wait until ‚Äútemporary‚Äù solutions out there. It will be more challenging in near future because of Myanmar locate font will become along with most of operating systems. For e.g, android 5.0 supports full system localization and by removing or replacing the system locale font with ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font, end-users lose a chance to use with native language and it gives headache for developers too.There are better solutions that will be beneficial in long-term and I think it is time to work out this problem with one way or another.      Stop using ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font and migrate to Unicode compliant font It is that simple but like I mentioned before, people are stubborn and don‚Äôt like changes. Some people propose solutions for existing systems to convert ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font to Unicode fonts. Please read thisZawgyi To Unicode Conversions Tips, Tricks and Risks  to save the length of this article, that was published at August 2011. This is what anti-‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font people are trying to pursue but it is not happening until now.        Make ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù font to 100% Unicode Compliant Since it‚Äôs partially Unicode font, there is a possibility to make it 100% Unicode font. Old versions of the font need to stop using and it is necessary to encourage users to use the latest one. End-users will keep using it with slight changes in typing but still existing applications and systems to convert from old version to ‚ÄúZawgyi‚Äù 100% Unicode font. In this way, all Burmese Unicode fonts are compatible and the problem solves.  To make this happenI can not do it alone. Other Burmese technicians also can‚Äôt do it alone. It should be initiated by associations like MCF &amp; MICA and make public announcements to make this happen. There are many hidden solutions out there such as converters, mobile applications, browser plugins and so on. The problem is not a technical issue. It‚Äôs people who need to change. I want to communicate my friends and family with Burmese texts instead of Burglish. I wanna write Burmese blogs and I wanna make hidden code comments with Burmese text. The problem of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see what you type‚Äù will be gone.Technicians and authorities should discuss this issue and try to come up with a solution. I believe that that day is coming soon and I will try to be a part of this."

    "snippet": "Introduction  This post is not suitable for people who requires lots of clothing for any reasons (for work, to get latest fashion and so on). Also for people who have tons of money to spen around. Well‚Ä¶they will never read this one for sure.Everyone has this problem at least once in their life and there are many solutions out there. Just google ‚Äúdecluttering wardrobe‚Äù.Some people might this ‚Äúis this really a thing to talk/discuss about?‚Äù. In my opinion, it‚Äôs important to think about for so many reasons. People buy clothes to wear it. Unfortunately, If you have a pile of clothes and you can‚Äôt spend time to maintain it, clothes wear you. From a t-shirt you bought, there are many thing you have to give for this one t-shirt. A place at your wardrobe. A place at your laundry list. A thought to remind you when to wear it. Extra 3 minute for ironing one more shirt.What‚Äôs so special about this post?This is not an article that guides you what to do. I read so many ‚Äúdo this,do that‚Äù article. I do laundry every 2 week,twice a month. My wardrobe is almost empty every 2 weeks. I spend around 2 hours ironing clothes. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs it. No more unnecessity and no chaos. I like to keep things simple and straightforward.This is how I declutter my wardrobe and tips on how to make things simple.Last In,First OutKeeping clean and downsize wardrobe doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúanti-buying‚Äù clothes. I am not living in a jungle or a cave. I have to look sharp and neat. People treats you better if you look neat and clean. I work at a molecular biotech lab and i usually wear informal. There is no dress code since it‚Äôs a research lab. I only wear formal for some occasions and one time, the old janitor greets me nicely because of the formal clothes. What I am trying to say is that people treats and distinguishes people class by clothing.I categorize my clothes into 4 groups; ones just bought recently (1), still ok (2) and weary ones (3) and clothes to give away (4). When I buy a new cloth,I shifted one cloth and move to next group. I wear number 1 and 2 as office wear and casual wear. For group 3, I wear it while I am staying in and put in the bag to give away for group 4.The purpose is to keep the ideal number of clothes I need without piling up bunch of clothes.Some productivity tips for clothing maintenance  I usually iron shirts and hang them at the wardrobe because folding them takes time.  For t-shirt, I keep them in several stacks according to my predefined groups.  Learn to iron quickly and systematically. So,you don‚Äôt need to spend like 5 minutes to iron one shirt. Check out this how to iron in 90 seconds.. This is how I iron clothes but it takes like 2 minutes per shirt because I also iron the back of the shirt.  When you are ironing, concentrate on what you are doing instead of watching TV or other multi-tasks.  Fold your socks in pair,so you are not gonna have a problem of missing sock.  It‚Äôs good to separate sports wear and do a separate laundry because these clothes are stinky and dirty.  For jeans, jackets and thick clothes, it is not necessary to wash it quite often. Using too much detergent is also a bad idea since it can wash out the color of the jean. Use more fabric softener and less detergent on these thick multi-layered clothes.  For bobbles or lint balls, use old razor blade and it works like magic.  For stinky shoes, put them in zip lock bag and freeze them over night.  For stain removing, this stain removal from clothes cover intensive cleaning tips for different type of stains.So, you might be thinking that‚Äôs a lot of stuffs to swallow. It‚Äôs worth to learn and there is several benefits from knowing these tips and tricks.Clothing &amp; TravelingFor a frequent traveler, they have their own system of organizing clothes. For a occasional traveler, it is difficult to estimate the type of clothes and the quantity to put in the luggage. There is no simple equation to make it easy. But think of these criteria which will make things easier:  How many nights are you staying?  Weather of destination?  Urban or Rural? (If you are going to a city, you can buy things easily.)  For minimal packing, think of clothes that can dry quickly and get rid of thick layer clothes.

For hardcore keyboard lover and people comfortable working at terminal, VIM is the best friend you can get for writing scripts, codes,a blog post or anything. Another advantage about learning vim mode and its shortcuts to navigate,modify text is that it is available as plug-ins for other text editors and IDEs. For instance, SublimeText,Brackets,Atom have vim plug-ins to imitate similar environment. So, the point that you don‚Äôt need to learn new shortcuts and key combinations to change a text editor. Just go to vim mode and work on.Now..What?This article is about gathering sources and information for starters and also for people who are already using VIM. I will list from basic fundamental usage of vim to installing plug-ins and modifying configuration files to improve user experience.Basic of VIMOpen terminal and type vimtutor to learn basic navigation and text editing of vim. Interactive Vim Tutorials is also a good place to start learning vim. I also wrote a blog post about VIM shortcuts. Learning depth for terminal users will be much easier than new terminal users or people who don‚Äôt use terminal at all(just use notepad or something with GUI).This blog series,learning vim in 2014 is also a advanced source for starters who got familiar with basic shortcuts and usage of VIM.For guys with no idea what to do after installing vim, check out Learning Vim Progressively.Configuring VIM and Plug-ins InstallationThere are so many ways to configure VIM to meet your preferences. For a serious configuration freaks, the easiest way is to check outVim Config:Sample and Sane vim configuration. You can browse github to see tons of configuration files by serious configuration freaks.Plug-ins and its managersThere are 2 main plug-in managers(vundle,pathogen) to improve UI, to provide various language supports and to get other advanced text editing features. Personally, I prefer vundle and it is easy to manage and install plug-ins. Best of Vim collects list of great plug-ins for Vim users. Another incredible source to look for specific plug-ins for specific programming languages and specific features at Vim Awesome.Is that it?Well‚Ä¶ If you feel comfortable and not afraid to use Vim, it can be said that you have a good start.

    "snippet": "It‚Äôve been a while I forcing myself to use Google Inbox. There might be a good reason why Google is forcing you to use its new flagship Material design. Material Design looks good and intuitive but using Google Inbox is not smooth and functional like GMail. Let‚Äôs me enlighten you why it‚Äôs that. For your judgments, all the opinions come from Web apps of GMail and Inbox.In other words, I don‚Äôt consider mobile GMail and Inbox apps.SettingsLike other email service providers, GMail provides you with advanced services like filtering, email default text setting,default signature setting and other advanced features for various level of users. Look at settings of Inbox, two things you can do literally. Turning on/off auto-bundled categories and turning on/off keyboard shortcuts.For veteran GMail users, all the settings they implemented for years just gone. It turns me off. Now, I just recognize all my email replies from Inbox without any signatures.In my option, Google should create a migration of user settings from GMail to Inbox somehow.Email ViewingTraditional email inbox is kind of static nature. An email comes in,it pops up on the inbox list. You replies the email and it creates mail-thread. I really love GMail auto categorization of emails, which Google introduces a while back. It groups email by categories and show in traditional timely manner.At Inbox, the inbox of Inbox (nested inboxes..lol!) is dynamic in nature. The categories becomes nested. Inbox orders email by timeline and followed by auto-bundled categories,which is also ordered by time-line. The unbundled emails shows as individuals,meaning that it‚Äôs not associated with any bundles. If you still don‚Äôt get it, take a look at Google inbox HelpIn my option, It‚Äôs more easier to track the defined set of websites,rather than the dynamic one with a particular pattern no one wants to learn. It‚Äôs a controversial issue and subjective.Email ComposingThe experience of composing a nice looking email at Inbox is quite terrible. Text box only contains basic formatting setting without any selection of fonts,font size and the most annoying thing is that there is no file browser for Google Drive. I work on Google Docs, Sheets for reporting and GMail works well with Drive integration. I would like to see the same setting for Inbox with comprehensive formatting settings.Nothing good about Inbox?After talking with things inbox let me down, I would like to list things Inbox is making it right.  Material Design.  Reminders and Snoozing. Sending yourself an email feels good.  Auto suggesting email addresses you usually communicate with.  Instead of zero inboxing, now you can just mark it as ‚ÄúDone‚ÄùAt the same time, I am thinking why Google doesn‚Äôt integrate these features to GMail. But, googling about Inbox gives me some thoughts on it and also why Google splits up GMail and Inbox.Further reading:      Google Inbox is lousy; try it for yourself and see if you agree        Why Did Google Decide To Split Inbox From Gmail?

    "snippet": "Last night, I was coding with Pycharms, which is a great IDE but the resource consumption is significant for my laptop with 4GB RAM. Running Chrome,Pycharms,terminal emulator,MySQLWorkbench &amp; Zeal slows down my machine. I am thinking of selecting another platform for small project Python coding. For that reason and to see the capabilities of text editors, this is the review of best text editors for Linux platform.Sublime Text 3So far, this is the text editor leading the world of coding text editors. Many people love it and use it for various reasons. Its package ecosystem is working quite well. The UI is OK. It‚Äôs intuitive. The performance is also fast without glitches and delay. The pain is in the setup and have to make your own system to keep tracks of packages you installed and manual keyboard shortcuts. To conclude, I believe it‚Äôs the best option for multi-language coders for a specific setup and standard.  Language Support: 4 out of 5  UI: 3 out of 5  Extensions: 4 out of 5  Performance: 4 out of 5  Configuration: 3 out of 5  Features: 3 out of 5AtomWell,IMO, it‚Äôs a ripoff of Sublime Text by Github since Github has a big fan-base of programmers. I can‚Äôt find things you can‚Äôt do at Sublime Text which offers from Atom except native Git integration. but come on! Settings panel is a plus. It‚Äôs a lot easier for lazy people who like to click things rather than writing settings in text(like me). To sum up, some might like it and some people might not impressed.  Language Support: 3 out of 5  UI: 3 out of 5  Extensions: 3 out of 5  Performance: 4 out of 5  Configuration: 4 out of 5  Features: 3 out of 5BracketsIt‚Äôs an open source editor from Adobe with neat UI. The interface is clean and nice. Like Atom, It came with built-in package manger which Sublime Text should do. Another sweet feature is Live Review. Without any setup,it can start up HTTP server monitoring your code change and reload it as necessary. I love it. It‚Äôs possible to do it with Sublime Text by installing plug-in. CSS preprocessors and in-line editing features also work quite well and I believe Adobe aims for front-end developers. I use brackets for static site coding.  Language Support: 2 out of 5  UI: 4 out of 5  Extensions: 3 out of 5  Performance: 4 out of 5  Configuration: 4 out of 5  Features: 3 out of 5LightTableThis one might be unique. The UI is minimal and silk. In-line code evaluation and watches are cool features. The constraints is that it only supports 3 languages at this moment,which are Clojure,Python &amp; Javascript. Dozens of plug-ins are available to install. Configuring settings is difficult compared with other text editors. I just wrote some python scripts and it is amazingly cool and intuitive. I will try this one for a while and come  back with comment  Language Support: 2 out of 5  UI: 4 out of 5  Extensions: 2 out of 5  Performance: 4 out of 5  Configuration: 2 out of 5  Features: 4 out of 5"

Long pressing quick setting doesn‚Äôt show me the specific setting and I wish this feature back.        Swiping is gone in AOSP keyboard of this CM12 beta ROM.        Another worth mentioning new feature is priority mode. It‚Äôs kind of ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode with more flexible options. The user can select specific apps to give notifications.        Screen pinning is also a new privacy feature added. A single app can be pinned for third party users and only the owner of the device can unlock it with the same setting you apply for your lock screen.        It imitates the user accounts control of PC Operating Systems, the user can create several user accounts such as guest and other accounts for kids and your family members.        The overall performance is getting better than previous android versions. Replacement of ART virtual runtime engine in place of Dalvik.        The battery life is also improved due to the outcome of Project Volta. From several experiments, it is proved that Android L batter life is increased to significant percentage of running time compared with android kitkat.  Finally, this is what I think of one week with Android L unoffical ROM. I believe android focuses on improving core features and UI &amp; animation is getting neat and clean. For customization junkies, the playground of android is getting bigger with new toys."

    "snippet": "Bye 2014 &amp; Things I thankful for‚Ä¶  Each year, I got in touch with new people, materials, and abstract subjects. This is the recap of things kept me going on until this far.PeopleFirstly, my family and my parents‚Ä¶who supported me for all the agreements and disagreements. And existing and new friends who helping me out and guiding me for chaotic, awkward and stupid situations of mine. I am not the best social communicator, but I will try to connect to expand my network.This is a tough year for me. My dad passes away at the end of last year and family is in mourning stage, especially my mom. Working and studying at the same time is also tough in terms of time management, insanity, and pressure. However, these people are kind and helping me to survive this long year.HardwareThanks my 2-year-old Asus Notebook for standing strong with me. It‚Äôs no fancy piece of machine but powerful and going on whenever I want. I will thank you by upgrading a new RAM and clean your surface regularly. I cleaned your ventilation system last month and so, I believe you can breathe more easily now.  My Samsung i9100 is also one unbelievable machine. Like a soldier in a war, it still keep going with scars and injuries. CM12 lollipop ROM is running and also a new battery is installed. I believe you will also feel happy with new upgrades. My 3-year-old Kindle Fire might be lonely because I kinda give her a retirement. I am sorry for people who are not comfortable to see me using old gadgets.The only thing I bought this year is a new Bluetooth headphone from Rapoo. It caught in the rain one time but my CPR skill rescues her from death. Running with this headphone is like shitting in a toilet while enjoying a music concert. After running with it for several times, the sweating smell stinks and I have to clean it regularly.   Also, my latest earbud‚Äôs sound quality is amazing. For 10$, it is  a worth to buy. Chinese guys are good at stealing technology.SoftwareMost of the applications and softwares make your life more complicated. Believe me! I am Technology Evangelist but technicians are trying every ideas to make it happen. They don‚Äôt give a sh@$ about the users. Software Developers are arrogant and they just want to show I can make this S&amp;*^s and that S#@%s.So, Is there any apps that help me to make my life easier?Short answer is Yes‚Ä¶.Long answer isThe softwares that help my life better in terms of making me motivate, productive, and ease which are      VOIP &amp; Messenger apps        News aggregators        Fitness tracking apps        Maps        Cloud Storage Services        Online Word Processors        Music Streaming Services  Except these apps, the rest categories are not that much useful for me.      social apps make me bloated.        games make me cheap.        shopping apps make me craving for stuffs.        Camera apps make me look things through lens instead of eyes.        Lifestyle apps are not necessary. More like ‚ÄúF*&amp;^ your life‚Äù apps.        Productivity apps are also not productive.  It makes you less productive. Just grab a notebook, pen and commitment. (I wrote a blog about this before.)  OnlinePeople did shameful and stupid things online like fighting at nonsense comment section, trolling other people, stealing things and watching pornography. I will skip bad parts and highlight good things I did online.      I tweet meaningful stuffs.        I organize playlists at Gibbon for fellow learners.        I contribute at Quora for thoughtful opinions and ask serious questions.        I make a blog to share debris and stuffs from my brain.        I talked with random people from Freenode IRC channels about various stuffs.Mostly at World Cup ‚Äò14        I learned several subjects through online learning platforms.        I create some music playlists at 8tracks.  Academica &amp; LearningThis year, I started self-learning Digital forensic for my thesis. The reason I decided to work on DF area is because it‚Äôs an interdisciplinary field between forensic science and computer science. A contribution to this area can help from e-crimes and e-discovery process. To catch bad guys in this IT world. I am also involving in a bioinformatics research project and in the near future, I can contribute to forensic plus bioinformatics project. I am terrible at biology, but my role is dealing with raw DNA datasets to clean up and analyze it for assembly process.   I am planning to learn more about bioinformatics, data science and Statistics.For side projects, I am working for small to mid-sized projects by flying solo or with a little help from my friends. I will try to keep up good work and make my brain active.Finally‚Ä¶.  Fight For ScienceBooksSome people read more books when they got older. But, I read more books like 5 years ago. I read for souls. I read to think. I read for wisdom. I read for knowledge. Thisera, we have several media channels to absorb information. paper media is fading away because it is difficult to access and expensive. Fewer people are reading newspaper and bookstores turn into a museum of printed media, rather than the source of knowledge. Even in university, students use tablets and laptops to learn. Should I call it paperless-learning system? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶At the start of this year, I am forcing myself to read actual books. Books with chapter 1,2,3‚Ä¶ Not just articles and blog posts from internet. I uploaded epub files to Google playbook platform to read it from my tablet and laptop. Still, it doesn‚Äôt feel like actual paper books which I can‚Äôt afford to buy at this moment.   Here are some of the books which I started to read this year;(on progress &amp; finished and non-technical books)      iWoz        I‚Äôll Go Home Then, It‚Äôs Warm and Has Chairs. The Unpublished Emails.        Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel        Geektastic: Stories from the Nerd Herd        The Math Book        Let‚Äôs Explore Diabetes with Owls        Googled: The End of the World As We Know It        Me Talk Pretty One Day        1Q84  MusicI listen to music all the time literally. I listen while working, walking, jogging, chilling and crying. I listen through streaming services, especially 8traksa &amp; spotify, and local storage. At 2014, the following artists are the ones I am thankful for making beautiful music;      Alt-J        Bleachers        Childish Gambino        A Great Big World        Dirty South        Lana Del Rey        Chance The Rapper        Cloud Nothing        Ed Sheeran        The 1975        The Antlers        Grimes        Beach House        God Speed You! Black Emperor        M83        The National        Frank Ocean        The  list goes on‚Ä¶.  FilmsSome good TV series got me exciting this year. For movies, it‚Äôs not that much except LEGO Movie‚Ä¶Good TV  Series in case you miss it      Black Mirror (Technology, Sci-fi)        Silicon Valley (Technology)        Halt and Catch Fire (Technology)        COSMOS: A Spacetime Odessey (Science)        True Detective (Drama)        Utopia (Drama, Sci-fi)  OutroductionPeople make ‚ÄúNew Year Resolutions‚Äù. It‚Äôs good for some people, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do it too. I don‚Äôt like forcing myself to do things. It‚Äôs more comfortable and easier for me to work things because of my conscious mind and my willingness. So, I reflects my previous year and will enjoy my next year with ‚Äúflexible planning‚Äù and ‚Äúflexible commitment‚Äù. Cheers!"

    "snippet": "Last night, I was wondering about availability of pomodoro timer for terminal. I saw several results with various technology.   terminal-pomodoro with node.js  A very simple Pomodoro timer for a terminal with bash script  Tim (Timer Script) with Zsh scriptWhat about python? I want the small tool which gives me visual and also audio notification. If I am away from terminal, audio notification is good for reminders.Pomodoro_Python V. 1.0So, I decided to implement a simple pomodoro timer with python. The code is roughly around ~50 lines but depends on SOX sound processor.It should be working properly with *nix system and I will tested with Windows system soon.Plan for Version 2.0I am planning to use argparse module to handle user customized parameters  and also additional features such as logging the activity in a flat file, taking session information and various notification schemes and so on."

    "snippet": "Paul. J. Meyer said  Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence,intelligent planning, and focused efffort.MindEveryone is trying hard to get productive including me. Mind is a strange thing to understand. It is difficult to focus on a single point. It running across multiple things within a flick of time. Help substance like caffeine, sugar boosts your concentration from distraction world. But the effects is only temporary and you brain cannot focus on anymore. Stress level got higher and we are looking for relaxations and more substances to calm our nerves‚Ä¶DistractionIt‚Äôs in everywhere. In your workstation. your living room. your bedroom. your phone. your machines. your girlfriend. It is not possible to get away from distractions. But we can minimize and compress it to certain ratio.but how‚Ä¶.‚ÄúHow to increase your productivity‚Äù mythThere are many tool, tips, hacks, tweaks and apps to increase our productivity. As an instance, I am app-junkie. I love to touch new released apps. For this type of people, the problem is that you know many apps, which some of them does the same thing. I never stick to one app and jumps to a new one with ‚Äòwow!‚Äô, ‚Äònice!‚Äô and ‚Äòsweet!‚Äô. For most people, I assume it might make their days easier but productivity apps decrease my productivity.In other words, I was consumed by productivity tools.Nowadays, most of the apps get mobility feature. That‚Äôs good but not helping that much in terms of productivity. Using multiple apps for various purpose will drain your time and energy. You need to get familiar with it (since it is developed by other people).For e.g,this is the possible list of apps used to increase productivity      Calendars        Daily/Monthly/Weekly planners        Schedulers (what is the difference with planning??? :))        Reminders        Time trackers        Expense trackers        TO-DO Lists        Mind Mappers        Brainstorming apps        Bookmark organizers        Organizers        Combination of these apps (moo.do)  By the look at this list, you will agree with me that you don‚Äôt need all of the tools. So, the question is ‚Äúwhich ones Ineed?‚Äù It depends on your work behavior and the way your mind works. The solution is that you need a system works for you. You need to know (guess) the easiest, comfortable system for you. Yes! We should implement our own productivity system.Own Productivity SystemThis is the process of how I try to think of my own productivity system. I try various applications and tools to see how long I can stick to these apps. Google Keep is good for listings and emergency note taking. The UI of Keep is easy to find and I use it for shopping list, travel checklist and other lists. I also save photos in keep for quick access like images of visa, passport and IDs. I stopped using Evernote  because it is frustrating with its features. Moo.do is good for drafting and scheduling, but I can‚Äôt make decisions of what should I use it for. Some people with horizontal mind might like Ginko. My main productivity tool is a small notebook( the one that can fit in your pant‚Äôs pocket)which you can carry around.For me, writing things down than typing it on computer is easier and comfortable. I can draw weird diagram, weird process tree, weird plans as I prefer. Just needs a pen!For daily planning,I divided 3 sections for planning; planning(not scheduling), time-tracking and notes about thoughts on the tasks.I plants a habit of planning things during dinner time or early morning at work. During lunch time, I reflects on tasks I done and adjust tasks for the rest of the day.I jot down for daily plan in a timely manner and during working on each task,track time to see the performance. Note sectionis for things popup related with tasks.It‚Äôs flexible and convenient. I also keep track of spening by at a header with number and abbrevations of spending items such as L for Lunch, T for transprots, D for dinner, B for beer and so on.Just need to maintain my notebook from forgetting ar coffee shop.For additional reading about creative scheduling,task planning and prductivity tools, this guy has several interesting templates you can print it out and use it.Check it out!DavidSeah‚Äôs blog"

However, my system doesn‚Äôt come up recovery menu. It shows me to type the root password but don‚Äôt give me enough time to type the whole password. (Weird!)By googling a bit, run into this post, which suggests me to edit the boot command manually to get recovery menu. At this time, it gives me enough time to type my root password and reset login password.Don‚Äôt forget to set root password of your ubuntu and its variants‚Äô system. Because if there is no root password, someone who has access to your physical machine can reset the password in 2 minutes. It‚Äôs easy to set up root password.

    "snippet": "Why Academic Papers?Within this two years, I‚Äôve been reading hundred of academic papers and conference journals for research projects and my ongoing thesis. I am also interested about typography and believe that it can change the preception of the readers. Good typefaces and typography arrangment can bring better readiability and impression to the readers. However, most of the academic papers is polluted with overused font and snoring typography schemes. In this article, I would like to make a comparison of how better typography can change the overall quality of the document appearence and style.Academic Paper FormatsThere are various style manual for the researchers and wrtier to follow. Generally, these style guides include information about margin, line height, structure of the content, citation style and so on. If you are not familiar with these styles, please see the follwing guide about popular style guides:  AMA Style Guide (pdf)  MLA Style Guide(pdf)  IEEE Style Guide(pdf)For post-graduate students and researchers affiliated with a particular institution, they have to follow the standard the organization used. For independent researchers, it depends on the style starndard of the research paper publishers. From my experience, most of the academic papers are worse, except papers from Elsevier. You can even say it terrible. Why? Bear with me and let‚Äôs take a look at some sample academic papers from different publishers.The following is the quotation of the first paragraph from A Writing Handbook.  The Modern Language Association (MLA) provides explicit, specific recommendations for the margins and spacing of academic papers. (For details on MLA‚Äôs typography guidelines, see: Document Format.) But the MLA Handbook‚Äôs advice on font selection is less precise: ‚ÄúAlways choose an easily readable typeface (e.g. Times New Roman) in which the regular style contrasts clearly with the italic, and set it to a standard size (e.g. 12 point)‚Äù (¬ß4.2).It can be seen that you have a choice over selecting reasonble typefaces, rather than typewriter fonts and typewriter layouts. Let‚Äôs take a look at some academic papers.The following two papers is from 2 different publishers. It‚Äôs quite obvious to make a decison between these two papers about which one possess better typography.The first paper is from Elsevier and the second paper is from IEEE.  Differences between these two papers are  line height of header text should be aligned center vertically.  Contents of both are justified but one with hypenation and another is not.  Font Quality(Elsevier uses Gulliver and IEEE uses Times New Roman )  Spacing between Number and Section header  Abstract section is lost emphasis in IEEE paper.  Footer and Footnote difference. Elsevier uses footnote for author contact and copyright information. IEEE mess eveything up about article information.  IEEE has unnecessary huge lane between two columns.  Generally, the layout of Elsevier paper is working better than IEEE.At the next section, I will do some experimental layout with several typefaces to see the improvements of IEEE paper and also the process of creating these documents.Elsevier Journal Paper formatIEEE Journal paper formatHow can it be improved?Firstly, The following proposed formats don‚Äôt follow any document standards. Just my imagination and knowledge‚Ä¶ You can decide on it‚Äôs working or not. The process of creating these documents are  select a proper layout (3 differnt layouts)  select a single serif font (seif font family is recommened font type for academic papers.)  Arrange the information into similar groups  Use my own common senseOk. Let‚Äôs take a look at 3 different documents on the same content.The common settings among these document is that margin is 1 inch, line-height is also 1,font size for conetent is 10 and font size for title is 16. Font size for header and footer is 9 points. Instead of paragraph indentation, try a blank line to create a whitespace.One thing to understand is that I created these documents with Google Doc and there is no feature to turn on auto hypentation. You can find how to turn on hypentation forproprietary word processors.Font Face: EB GaramondIt seems to be working quite well. The header and footer is getting orgranized with similar information and humanist typeface make the paper elegant.Font Face: MerriweatherThe fontface is not created for printing media but it‚Äôs suprisingly working well. It‚Äôs more easier to read, compared with previous document but the tradeoffs is that fewer words cover in the first page. Also,notice that font size  10 of Merriweather looks bigger than EB Garamond.Font Face: Crete RoundSlab serif is not a good fontface for block of texts. It‚Äôs better to use for texts within table instead of courier. The layout is not the common one used by academic papers.Font RecommendationsDr. Mark Womack said‚Ä¶  I usually ask my students to use Century Schoolbook or Palatino for their papers. If your teacher requires you to submit your papers in a particular font, do so. (Unless they require you to use Arial, in which case drop the class.)A good serif font with proper size (10-12 points) according to the layout. 2 column layout needs smaller size than one column.Be all papers have better typography‚Ä¶To conclude, I belive that all publishers should exercise a good typography scheme like Elsiver do."

It is nice to see that there are tons of pre-exisitng applications for terminal workers.SOXIt stands for Sound eXchange and it‚Äôs a application for sound processing. It is capable of converting music format from one to another.  Also,you can use it as a simple terminal music player.To play music with SOX, just need to know a bit about wildcards and terminal knowledge. To exit SOX, press Cltr-C. If you queue multiple songs with asterik wildcards,press Cltr-C twice will exit SOX and Cltr-C will skip to the next track.#install sox and coded lib for it$ sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all#play music$ ls ~/Music#play a song$play track_1.mp3 #play all mp3s in a foler$play *.mp3CMUSCMUS is more advanced than SOX with various features such as creating a library, queuing selected songs into current playlists. To get the latest release version, the developer recommend to download from cmus github repo and compile it.Basic usageYou can nvaigate different pannel by pressing 1 to 5;  1: Artist/Albumn View  2: Library  3: Playlist  4: Current Playlist  5: File Browser. Go to 5 to add music by navigating with arrow keys and press a to add music files/folders. Press enter to play a track and c to pause the music.

    "date": "2014-10-14 00:00:00 +0700",
    





    "snippet": "I am researching on private browsing mode in terms of forensic study and analysis. Yesterday,I ran into one article about difference between private browsing mode of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.I made some feedbacks on this article as a conversation style. Some of the points will be controversial. The purpose of this blog is to fill in some insights on this particular topic. So, end-users and other interested parties can make good judgments on it.  Most modern browsers ship with a private browsing mode that can be started independently from the main browsing session. It prevents the recording of history information in the browser so that information about the private browsing session cannot be retrieved once the window has been closed.Not most browsers. All five major browsers (Safari,Chrome,Firefox,Opera,Internet Explorer) have private browsing mode. The first one is Safari browser introduced by Apple at 2005. Basically, private browsing mode is sufficient for normal users to prevent their browsing activities. However, there are several proposed research that can recover the browsing records from private browsing session. To sum up, Internet Explorer left digital artifacts at persistent storage and the rests can be found in persistent storage or volatile data or both.  While it is certainly possible to achieve the same goal manually without that mode, for instance by clearing the history, cookies and cache files selectively to erase traces, it is comfortable to use and not as time-consuming.Private browsing is easy to use but it is not possible to say the private browsing mode is equivalent to normal browsing mode plus clearing history,cookie and cache. The process flow and mechanism used in both modes are not the same. The browser vendors don‚Äôt provide these information because of security reasons but according to the existing academic forensic study, it is difficult to say the data security level of these browsing modes are the same.  All private browsing modes work in a similar way. They spawn in a new browser window which is independent from the main session. Users can open tabs in the window and access as many sites as they want.According to this study, the data accessibility between public browsing mode and private browsing mode is not the same among different browsers. Chrome browser is the best browser  in terms of security practices. Google introduces browser sandboxing at 2008. (I am not sure about other browsers.Please fill me on this.). Another protocol that makes Google and Firefox special is safebrowsing. Generally,it checks all URLs and downloads against the database to see possible security violation and according to the result, ResourceRequester handles the permissions of OS resource requests.  There is however a difference between how Firefox‚Äôs private browsing and Chrome‚Äôs incognito mode function.Yes. It is.  If you are using Chrome‚Äôs incognito mode, you may have noticed that you cannot restore a closed tab in that mode. Not every user requires that functionality but if ?you happen to use the mode a lot, you may have encountered situations where you closed a tab only to come to a point later on where you needed to re-open it in the browser. That‚Äôs not possible however and if you cannot remember the address or the site you opened it from, you are out of luck and cannot open it again.It is more like UI interaction difference than the core functionality ones. From the point of view from end-user,what you said is right but difficult to agree that this difference reflects the private browsing behavior of Firefox and Chrome.  And Firefox? Firefox handles private browsing windows as their own instances. This means that you can re-open closed tabs when you are using Firefox‚Äôs private browsing mode. To do so either use Ctrl-Shift-t or right-click on the tab bar and select the undo close tab option from the context menu.Due to sandbox security, Chrome runs each tab as separate instances no matter it is in normal or private browsing mode. From a quick duckduckgoing, the similar security concept applies to Firefox like you said. However,I am not sure how it is related to browser running as its own instances.  Side note: Opera handles this the same way as Google Chrome, likely because it is also based on Chromium, while Microsoft‚Äôs Internet Explorer the same way as Firefox.Yes. Opera adopts Chromium components such as blink,v8‚Ä¶like everything except the UI engine. IE and Firefox might have the same feature,‚Äôcan reopen the closed tab at private browsing mode‚Äô. The implementation of these two browsers is like 99% different.  You may wonder why the implementation differs when it comes to the undoing of tabs in private browsing. There does not appear to be an official answer for that but the most likely explanation is that Firefox and Internet Explorer handle the information on the window level while Chromium-based browsers on a tab level instead.I don‚Äôt understand the term you used ‚Äòtab level‚Äô and ‚Äòwindow level‚Äô.  Are you using a private browsing mode? Which implementation makes more sense to you?IMO, the private browsing mode should not allowed to open closed tab. It beats the purpose of it since private browsing mode try to erase all the traces left on host machine. If the tab can re-open it, it means that it is most likely on persistent storage rather than on volatile storage. I might be wrong but that‚Äôs the only explanation I can find."

    "snippet": "Ubuntu &amp; MeI just upgraded my Ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04 LTS. In this piece, I‚Äôd like to  talk about my user experience on Ubuntu.This is personal review of Ubuntu from a average user with 2+ year experience. This is my first Linux distro and the first version I used is Ubuntu ver. 8. At that time,the internet access is so terrible in my country and I gave it up. At 2012, I restarted my Linux journey because of a new job.UnityBefore 14.04, I replaced Unity with Xfce since I feel like unity seems to be taking too much resources. Now,I am heading back to Unity to see improvement. The result is there is no significant changes with some polishes in here and there. I use Synapse instead of Hub and I still strongly believe that it should be included as default app launcher.Laucher bar can minimize to 16px is a good thing since nobody like to waste spaces. Snapping windows is working and that‚Äôs awesome. For backup and resource intensive work,I am working with i3 window manager. To conclude, Unity is the best looking window manager but the trade offs is computational power.Web AppsIt seems like a good idea but fails. I don‚Äôt like to open a gmail as web-app container which costs you around 100-ish RAM usage.Notification indicatorsIndicators are cool and handy but still taking too much resources. One weather notif indicators take around 30MB RAM.NautilusI have no problem with this wm but some tweaks like sushi should be came along with it.One problem is that for unknown reason,it seems to crash while copying data from/to external devices,especially when copying data size is in GB digits.Geek it upAs a fallback and concentration mode,I installed i3 wm that is simple tiling windows manger. You just spend some time with the configuration file and it‚Äôs good to go for tasks with demanding high computational power. I also use it to avoid the distractions of Unity graphic and UI interaction.It takes some time to get use to it but it‚Äôs worht your time.Sum upAs a summary, Ubuntu is the Linux distro that grows with me. It‚Äôs good for newbies,average users and people enjoys beautiful operating system with interaction and animation.The Ubuntu community might be the biggest one among Linux distro and for that reason, the learning curve can be slightly lower than others. For the troubleshooting, Ubuntu forum &amp; askUbuntu from StackExchange do a good job. Just have a decent machine with average computational power and enjoy the taste of open source platform."

    "snippet": "Chrome 35There are several changes in the newest release of Google Chrome browser. Most of the people are talking about notification center, Google Now integration and so on. For linux people, they are interested about new graphic engine called Aura. It‚Äôs intersting but I am not gonna list down all new features introduce at Chrome 35.Let‚Äôs get down to what this blog is about.Remote DebuggingWhat I am interesting is about remote debugging through your mobile devices through chrome browser. The questions I pop up when I am reading about that feature is that it is gonna work like it said,what about the limitation and what are the provided functonalities. This is gonna be a huge change for developers since it can change the way coders handle with multiple devices.Effects on web developmentUntil this point,the only way I apply when implementing a responsive website is by checking a tool like Dimensions, which is a useful chrome extension. However,I never think of remote debugging the web dev project directly through the mobile devices. What I like about this chrome remote debugging capability is that the configuration and setup is super easy and straightforward. Just spend 5 mins on the documentaion and go for it. Screencasting and port forwarding features just the functionalities what you will need. Ok. I will continue about the setup overview and walkthorough of it in next section.Requirements  Chrome on your pc with ver.&gt; 35  Chrome on android with ver.&gt; 35  turn on usb ‚Äòdebugging mode‚Äô on your android          If android ver&gt;4.2, press ‚ÄòBuild number‚Äô x 7 times to turn on ‚Äòdeveloper options‚Äô      if you don‚Äôt know the location of ‚ÄòBuild number‚Äô, figure out yourself        Connect it with usb cable and go to chrome://inspect at your PC‚Äôs chrome browser  Tick ‚ÄòDiscover USB Devices‚Äô option and you should see your device list down under it.FeaturesAfter you succed in connecting your devices with Chrome, you can debug the website on your mobile. Screencasting feature is quite awesome. It make your life easier by mirroring the display on your pc‚Äôs browser. Now,you can inspect,debug and work on it. Another feature is called port forwarding. It‚Äôs for your local project to view it on the mobile. The details about features and functionalities can be found at  offical documentation.ConclusionIn my humble opinion, I never tried it at beta stage before. The funcationalities and features of this version is quite stable and working well. For more information, this is a good article by Paul Irish, whom is a developer of chromium project, HTML5 boilerplate and so on. In this article, it also talks about mobile emulation and user agent switching from more than webkits."

The IDS type I try out is the former type.PurposeSince I am working on browser forensic, the first experiment is to know how the browser changes the file integrity for different stages and where the changes happen to the host machine. This is not the only functionalities of OSSEC. It can do more than file intrgrity checking.For more information about OSSEC functionalites:  OSSEC FeatureArchitectureOSSEC can works in two modes: agent or agentless. It depends on what you wanna do. If you want a centralized server to monitor the rest of the machines in the network, the manager-agent mode is recommended. Agentless mode is to monitor one machine,which can‚Äôt install agent program, without the monitoring server.(however,there is no binary file for windows OS for that mode.)About internalarchitecture: OSSEC Log Analysis/Inspection Architecture###InstallationInstallation is quite straightforward and easy to follow. The first step is setup OSSEC manager to centralized server.After that, install the agent progam to the servers you want to monitor. The exact provess will be varied upon the operating systems you are working on and your objective of installing OSSEC.For more information: OSSEC Installation manualSetupFor my setup, I installed OSSEC-HIDS on a Ubuntu machine and create a guestOS as a TEST-Server.This is the general information about the setup.  make a guest-OS,windows 8 on virtualbox  Host machine: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS  RAM Share: 1024 MB  HD: dynamic allocation up to 15GBFor my experience, there are some tips I can give at this point:Check your log at both manager and agent to see what going on.

Don t make friends with people who are sinking under the floor of consumerism.  Make a bigger saving plan.  Don t be too extreme. You needs a clean underpants and cozy bed to sleep well..  Read  mnmlist..  Credit card is not for me.  Make list of maximum posessions per category such as 10 shirts,7 underpants, one laptop and no tablet.  Believe in it.Yay facts  More Savings.

When I am pre-processing these data-sets, it generates more files which are at least 3x bigger than the original file. What happen is that I run out of storage in sever even though it still has like 80 GB free space left. However, that‚Äôs not enough for a 25 GB sra file to split into single-ended file.So,my supervisor told me to map a network storage or find a solution to solve.Ok.I did some light research about Network File Sharing within a local closed network. My idea is to setup a file shared server. In this way,backing up data becomes easier and my collagues can share the files.I am quite sure I got a lecture about this but I might be sleepy or day-dreaming or brain-dump period or just simply dumb to remember easily.Here is the recap of these three network sharing technology.Network File Sharing (NFS)It‚Äôs the distributed file system protocol usually used in Unix Operating System. NFS dameon is runnning in server sites and configure the list of export folders. After that,install the client package to get access to the network share. It‚Äôs effictive for large files and for permanent setup.Common Internet File System (CIFS)It works on application layer network protocol and also known as Server Message Block (SMB). Micorsoft Windows Network share uses this protocol and Samba is an implemantion of CIFS to work along in Unix system.SambaSamba is an open-source project to share resources among windows and linux mixed-network."
