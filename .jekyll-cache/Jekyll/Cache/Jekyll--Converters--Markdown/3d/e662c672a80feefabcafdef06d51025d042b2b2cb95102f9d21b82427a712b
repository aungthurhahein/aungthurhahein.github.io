  <p>You left me.<br />
You left us.<br />
Been 103 days..<br />
Mom is still weeping.<br />
Experience of encountering death shocks me.</p>

  <p>We ainâ€™t best father and son relationship.<br />
No best fatherâ€¦<br />
No best son in the worldâ€¦</p>

  <p>I only had one dad<br />
And <br />
Nowâ€¦<br />
Count down to zero.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regret Iâ€™ve been red to you.<br />
Wish I had last words with you<br />
I am thankful for your teaching and inspiration</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goâ€¦<br />
Have a peaceful life<br />
In this word<br />
In another world</p>

  <p>Wait for me.<br />
I wanna finish the last conversation with you..<br />
R.I.Pâ€¦ Dad</p>
