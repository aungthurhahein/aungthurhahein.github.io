Since Google announced Android L 5.0 (codename:Lollipop), I was so eager to try it on. Unfortunately, it is only available for Google edition Nexus phones, which I donâ€™t have one. My old galaxy sII is on CM11 ROM, android 4.4.2. I am waiting for cynamogenmod team to come up with CM12 ROM with android 5.0.</p>
