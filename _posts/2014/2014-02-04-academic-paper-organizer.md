Since I've been doing research for my master, I have to spend lots of time reading journal and conference papers. The problem is organizing these papers. 

I did a little research to find some ways to automate the tedious task of downloading paper,organizing by author,date,conference and so on. 

I found some tools which are 

#### Zotero
It is a good citation tool which is multiplatform and can synchronize your library across your machines. The ***free*** account only offers 300 MB webstorage. That's the only problem I found and I starts with Zotero.

#### Mendeley
Mendley is the tool I jumped after I run out of Zotero web space. Importing zotero database  to Mendley is super easy and also works well with multi-platforms. Tab based UI is more convenient and also possible to search withinn the application. Another feature I love is correcting the citation and detailed information of documents.

#### EndNote
EndNote is a commerical tool with 30 days trial. Not available for Linux platform. period. 
That's not what I am looking for. Free is good. Free is the best.

Now,I am synchronize zotero and mendeley to get the most out of these tools. Anyway,these tools save my life.
