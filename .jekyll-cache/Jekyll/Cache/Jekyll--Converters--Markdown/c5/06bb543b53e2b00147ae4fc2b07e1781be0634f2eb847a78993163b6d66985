I"><p><a href="http://themerapp.com/" target="_blank">Themer</a> is a theme platform that android veterans are looking for. It was started as a closed source,so I didn’t have a chance to try it. 
Waiting for invitation code and it didn’t come to my inbox.</p>

<p>Now,no more invitation and you can download it at GPlay Store and it won’t let you down. It is still in Beta and a little glitch in widget customization. However,the rest of the feature is killing.</p>
