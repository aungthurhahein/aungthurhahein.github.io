I"<p>I have some down time at this week and decided to reinvent my blog site with new look and organization. This is the first entry after I redesigned and deployed this new site. Throughout the decision making process on the choice of platform and tools, I got some ideas and update to share with you, my friends..</p>

<h2 id="platforms-for-blogging-or-newsletters">Platforms for blogging or Newsletters</h2>

<p>There are criteria that helps to narrow down the options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Free or Paid Options üí∞</li>
  <li>Self-hosted website, social media or community platforms? üè†</li>
  <li>Type of content? (blogs, art/design or professional articles) üßëüèº‚Äçüé®</li>
  <li>Support of newsletter integration and comment üì∞</li>
  <li>Technical capability of you or your team (custom domain setup, Hosting setup, CMS knowledge, VCS, CI/CD flow, General Web Development skills) ü•∑üèª</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="options">Options</h3>

<p>These questions will give a guideline on the path that you can decide for your blog or portfolio website.  The following mind map shows a glance of the options that you can pick from.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a lot of options but after browsing through some of these services, you will have an initial idea of the blogging platform that can fit your requirement.</p>

<p>As for non-technical friends that want to kick start a blog, a site like <strong><em>Medium</em></strong> or <strong><em>Ghost</em></strong> is a good start for general bloggers and <strong><em>SubStack</em></strong> for professional writers.</p>

<p>I included ‚ÄúBy Technology‚Äù for developers and technical guys who want to study or build a website based on a particular JS framework such as <strong>Hexo</strong> and Jekyll.</p>

<p>Another interesting choice for <strong><a href="http://Notion.so">Notion.so</a></strong> user is blog based on Notion with no-brainer setup.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-select-github-pages-for-blogging">Why I select GitHub Pages for blogging</h3>

<p>If you knows a bit of web development and CI/CD flow, there are options that you can craft website with template and customize before hosting to the hosting services ranged from Github to AWS. This is a decision making flow for mine:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I was not looking for community blogs like Medium as primary site.</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt want to pay for subscription for using platform except custom domain set up.</li>
  <li>I want to maintain all my blog posts in markdown format locally as backup and also want to customize theme and custom domain.</li>
  <li>Jekyll is my choice of tech stack with markdown editor support</li>
  <li>I mostly blog text with few images.</li>
  <li>I just want to use GitHub to maintain source code and content.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was using [<strong>Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)</strong> for ~5 years and it is a good option for tech savvy want to try small website.  It is relatively easy to start with <a href="http://user.github.io">user.github.io</a> domain that you can set up custom domain. Remember, It‚Äôs ONLY for a static page website and NOT ideal for web applications. I do have Medium account that I posted some of the blogs from my main site as a way to promote using its strong community users.</p>

<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It is always ideal to choose the platform or approach that you can backup or export out your blogs for migration to another platform. To avoid <strong>platform lock-in.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Markdown</strong> is a must-know markup language for bloggers because many of the platform relies on it. OR use <a href="http://Notion.so">Notion.so</a> for markdown writing and export it out.</li>
  <li><strong>Git</strong> version control system if you maintain blog site by yourself.</li>
  <li>Boosting SEO and audience is always a challenge if you working to set up a self-hosted site or from scratch.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication channel</strong> and <strong>newsletter integration</strong> is not available in free platforms and it needs 3rd party integrations or paid tier in the platforms.</li>
  <li>Custom domain needs to purchase by yourself from <a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> or <a href="http://godady.com">godady.com</a> and most freemium sites required a paid tier to set it up.</li>
</ul>
