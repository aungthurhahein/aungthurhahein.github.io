It s the buzz word in web-design,*"minimalism"*. 

What if your life minimize to a certain ratio?

What if you reduces your desires and becomes anti-consumerism?

It follows the teaching of Buddha too. However,people likes to have *newest,most expensive,the rarest* possessions on their hands. 

> To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as oneâ€™s own in the midst of abundance.

The question is do you need all of these belongings? 

Do your life needs to carry all these stuffs with you?

Most people thinks having expensive clothings,fastest car and latest techie promises **Happiness**. However,I believe it can t delivers happiness and make you desire more and more. 

People are living in this vicious cycle.

Recent incident with my landlord makes me realize about our complex chaos life. When we move-in, she makes a statment about the shoes me and my room-mate have.

> You only have 2 feet,why you needs lots of pairs of shoe....

Being minimalist is simple and have both beneifts and tradeoffs.

>My policy is think 7 days before you desire to buy an object. If you forget it,you don t need/want it.
