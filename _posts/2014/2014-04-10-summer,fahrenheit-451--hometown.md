Starts from next week,it is a new year for some of South east asian countries including my land. I am going back to my hometown and plan to enjoy quality time with my family. Aparts from that, I planned to do some reading,one light reading & one heavy reading.The two books I will try to read this holiday. Both of them are aged and almost the same age with me.

#### Fahrenheit 451 & A method of Programming

Both of them gives me impression in different way. I want to find out that the author imagination of the future meets with current situation. The author of second book is well known inventor of dijkstra algorithm. One of my fellow coders tell me that it can fills the gap I missed in my foundation.Enlightment!

Let's see I can finish my objectives for this 10 day holiday.
