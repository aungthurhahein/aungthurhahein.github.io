      A look back into 2021, it’s not the year that I achieve something to proud of. The mental state of mind is not the best and the way that I look into life and the world is changed. The motherland is in turmoil and approaching to become a failed-state. Uncertainty is very high in all citizens, the people who can enjoy their lives with whatever they have.

      2020 is a tough year for everyone. For me, there is some months like house arrest alone. A year passed by and we are in 2021 with changes in our daily life style and the way we live, work and enjoy life. People are fighting for this virus outbreak but most people believe in our survival instinct and health system.

Well, this is the credential for security practioners like us that hard to prove the market that “I kinda of know what I am doing and would like HR personnel to make their job easier”. A bit of morale dellima in taking this exam but I have to say the learning experience and knowlege gain is worth the pain. This is a bit of extension on what I jot down at reddit post.
