When I was at 9th grade, the language teacher gave a essay homework to write about your goal and carrer. At that time,I have nothing in mind but I am into computers so much. Windows 98 is a magical word for me to explore at my spare time. I wrote about how I want to become a "computer guy" without no specific specialization.

I studies to get Computer Science degree and become a guy who writes code and trying to put things into logical concept. So far, people in my life think of me from different perspectives. 

My family think...

* My mother don't know what I really do for a living until now
* My sisters think I learned and working really difficult things but don't get a lot of money
* My brother thinks I am good with computer and any thing with pressable buttons but surprised after I have no idea how to tune TV channels 

My friends think...

* The guy who can install Windows like it's nothing but don't know how to create equations in Microsoft Excel.
* The guy who magically upgrades latest Android version to super old phone handset
* The guy who is on most Internet services and still finding out new products
* The guy who really excited to talk about technical things at any situation
* Some friends who do business don't understand why I choose to do this pathetic job

I think...

* I don't know anything in details and throughly
* I am fucking lazy to make codes prettier
* "new ideas" written done in my notebook never become real products
* Boss and managers don't understand me
* I don't understand myself too
