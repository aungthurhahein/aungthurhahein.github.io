Crazy shits happen to all people. These are situations I am afraid it will happen to me. The order are in ascending of the scariness. 

* slip from the platform,fall down to the road and vehicle runs over my head
* point metal spear-shaped rod fall into my head
* someone breaks into my apartment and kill me in my sleep
* elevator malfunction and cut through my body through half while I am approaching into it
* Two vehicles hit me at the same time in the middle of the road and I have no idea that I gonna die terribly 
* I am relaxing in my apartment and the whole apartment electrocuted.
* Thunder strikes me while I am combing my beautiful wavy hair
* Slip and trip over the bathroom floor and knocks my head after falling down reversely
* Airplane crush
* Truck full of heavy objects is out of control and heavy objects such as containers and gas tanks roll over,explode and fall over the vehicle I am in

Yeah. World is full with  "Final Destination" shits. 

Watchout. Live or Die, 51% vs 49%
