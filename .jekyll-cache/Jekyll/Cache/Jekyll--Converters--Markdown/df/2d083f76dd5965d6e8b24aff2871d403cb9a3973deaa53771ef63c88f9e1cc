I"æ<h3 id="why-vim">Why Vim?</h3>
<p>Vi Improved is the most advanced terminal text editor and I donâ€™t need to point out its awesomeness here. For hardcore keyboard lover and people comfortable working at terminal, VIM is the best friend you can get for writing scripts, codes,a blog post or anything. 
Another advantage about learning vim mode and its shortcuts to navigate,modify text is that it is available as plug-ins for other text editors and IDEs. For instance, SublimeText,Brackets,Atom have vim plug-ins to imitate similar environment. So, the point that you donâ€™t need to learn new shortcuts and key combinations to change a text editor. Just go to vim mode and work on.</p>
