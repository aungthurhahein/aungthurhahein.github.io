I"—<p>When I was at 9th grade, the language teacher gave a essay homework to write about your goal and carrer. At that time,I have nothing in mind but I am into computers so much. Windows 98 is a magical word for me to explore at my spare time. I wrote about how I want to become a ‚Äúcomputer guy‚Äù without no specific specialization.</p>

<p>I studies to get Computer Science degree and become a guy who writes code and trying to put things into logical concept. So far, people in my life think of me from different perspectives.</p>

<p>My family think‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>My mother don‚Äôt know what I really do for a living until now</li>
  <li>My sisters think I learned and working really difficult things but don‚Äôt get a lot of money</li>
  <li>My brother thinks I am good with computer and any thing with pressable buttons but surprised after I have no idea how to tune TV channels</li>
</ul>

<p>My friends think‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>The guy who can install Windows like it‚Äôs nothing but don‚Äôt know how to create equations in Microsoft Excel.</li>
  <li>The guy who magically upgrades latest Android version to super old phone handset</li>
  <li>The guy who is on most Internet services and still finding out new products</li>
  <li>The guy who really excited to talk about technical things at any situation</li>
  <li>Some friends who do business don‚Äôt understand why I choose to do this pathetic job</li>
</ul>

<p>I think‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don‚Äôt know anything in details and throughly</li>
  <li>I am fucking lazy to make codes prettier</li>
  <li>‚Äúnew ideas‚Äù written done in my notebook never become real products</li>
  <li>Boss and managers don‚Äôt understand me</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt understand myself too</li>
</ul>
