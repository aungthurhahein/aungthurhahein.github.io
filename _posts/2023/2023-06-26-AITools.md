In 2023, we are witnessing a fast-growing market of value-added services on top of AI models, thanks in part to the availability of OpenAI's ChatGPT to the public. With so many services available, it can be difficult to determine which ones are worth your time and effort. In this post, I'll share some free services that you can use to improve your productivity and workflow. Please note that while these services don't involve any monetary cost, you should be aware of the data privacy policies and terms and conditions of the developers.

Due to the popularity of ChatGPT (powered by [GPT-n foundation Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer)) and Bard (powered by [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/)), I’ll skip these 2 influencers and starts with the other hidden gems in no particular order.

Please aware that any of the services that I listed can change from free, freemium to paid plans with no options at the time of your reading.
