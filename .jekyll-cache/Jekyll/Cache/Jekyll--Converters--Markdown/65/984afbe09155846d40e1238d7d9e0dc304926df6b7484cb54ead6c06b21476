<p>Women buy things they fancy. The same applies to men. Men even fall into the category of buying things that are useless and not make life more organizing and productive. I am the kind of guy beat myself up when I end up owning some stupid things. I believe in minimalism and the concept of ‚Äúbuying less‚Äù and live simply. It makes my life easy and declutter without chaos in your room. I only buy things I really need, I find it elegant and beauty in it.</p>

<p>This is more of a personal note of why I own and planning to buy. Of course, I have more of the small items that civilized humans need like cleaning products and bedsheets. This is more of some items that I am doubtful to own but end up being useful to me. There are many similar posts on the Internet and you can google it to get a thought or two.</p>

<p>If you like to expand your knowledge and stimulate your thoughts and idea, reading is the essential habit to build up. Actual books are good if you have money and spaces for it. I bought a kindle e-book reader and it don‚Äôt let me down and boost my reading. Just get any reliable e-book reader and you will not disappointed. Don‚Äôt ask me why not a LCD tablet. I know it can do more but it can‚Äôt be a dedicated book reading gadget and distraction of course‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="laptop">laptop</h3>

<p>If you are not a gamer and graphic designer, a laptop is suitable for all sort of professions. It‚Äôs small, mobile and easy to maintain. If you are fancy getting a desktop PC, ask yourself why. Do I need a resource intensive computer system? Do I need to replace and upgrade hardware components in the near future? If the answers is no,go get a laptop.</p>

<h3 id="smart-tv-box">Smart TV Box</h3>

<p>I am not talking about smart TV. It‚Äôs expensive and the features are limited. It can be android,Roku or Apple TV box that you can connect with any TVs that have HDMI connectivity. I got an android TV box with my personal setup and the things that little box can do please me well.</p>

<h3 id="sound-bar">Sound-bar</h3>

<h3 id="suit">Suit</h3>

<p>For occasional ceremony, a good tailored suit is a must-have for all grow-up men but not a fancy color. Go for a classic decent looking color that match your style and taste.</p>

<h3 id="knit-tie">Knit Tie</h3>

<p>A knit tie is something you can wear it to dress up or down. I ordered one from China and it is surprising good quality. It is consider as more casual than woven tie but it seems ok for South East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="dress-shirt">Dress shirt</h3>
<p>It should contrast with the suit you are wearing it with. For e.g, if the suit color is navy blue, the dress shirt should be white or a color that is lighter than navy blue. Also,beware of the size;being too fit or too loose.</p>

<h3 id="casual-blazer">Casual Blazer</h3>

<p>This is the piece of clothes that can go with most of your other clothes; tee,t-shirt,jeans,pants or even shorts! It makes you get a look that some people called it ‚Äúsmart casual‚Äù and the occasions that you don‚Äôt want to look too formal and this piece of clothing solves the problem.</p>

<h3 id="oxford-shirt">Oxford Shirt</h3>

<p>This is another clothes that can go with anything. Go for long sleeves because you can fold the sleeves up anyhow.</p>

<h3 id="belts">Belts</h3>

<p>Try to get a color matched belt for your leather shoes. Wearing different color of belt and shoe just look odd. For casual look, you can go creative.</p>
