I"$<p>Most people encounters distractions while working or studying,especially for people who are working with computer. Sometimes, it seems like infeasible to control yourself from unproductive time-consuming behaviors. A lots of ‘ Oops,I should head back to work instead of facebooking or never-ending tweeting.’</p>

<p>One life hack I found out is called  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>. It’s a simple time management technique which is easy to understand and follow. To master it,it may takes a week or so. I am exercising that technique with a help of a chrome plugin called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd" target="_blank">Strict Workflow</a>. It is at least working for me. I can concentrate more on what I am working on and I can estimate how many <em>pomodoros</em> I need for one task.</p>

<p>Sounds Interesting? Take a look at <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">offical website</a>.</p>
