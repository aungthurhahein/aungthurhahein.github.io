I"?<p>As the tile gives a hint, ctrl+space shortcut is not working system wide on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with cinnamon DE. I noticed while I was started using LightTable IDE. I asked to INTERNET people and they are giving me some thoughts. Today, I am memorizing shortcuts of Pycharms and realized that ctrl+space is not workig at Pycharms too. Waitt.. After duckduckgoing about this issue, I found a solution to fix it. The problem is that <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus" target="_blank">ibus</a> default triggger hotkey is ctrl+space and it is interrupting.</p>
