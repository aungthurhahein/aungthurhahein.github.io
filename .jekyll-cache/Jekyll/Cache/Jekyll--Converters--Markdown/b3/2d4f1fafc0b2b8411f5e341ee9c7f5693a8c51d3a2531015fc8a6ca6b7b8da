I"`<p>Last night, I was wondering about availability of pomodoro timer for terminal. I saw several results with various technology.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Juev/terminal-pomodoro" target="_blank"> terminal-pomodoro</a> with node.js</li>
  <li><a href="http://magnatecha.com/very-simple-pomodoro-timer-for-a-terminal/" target="_blank">A very simple Pomodoro timer for a terminal</a> with bash script</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ggustafsson/Tim" target="_blank">Tim (Timer Script)</a> with Zsh script</li>
</ul>

<p>What about python? I want the small tool which gives me visual and also audio notification. If I am away from terminal, audio notification is good for reminders.</p>

<p>So, I decided to implement a simple pomodoro timer with python. The code is roughly around ~50 lines but depends on SOX sound processor.</p>

<p>It should be working properly with *nix system and I will tested with Windows system soon.</p>

<h4 id="plan-for-version-20">Plan for Version 2.0</h4>

<p>I am planning to use argparse module to handle user customized parameters  and also additional features such as logging the activity in a flat file, taking session information and various notification schemes and so on.</p>
