I"Ý<p>During my master research on Digital Forensic of Data Discovery of Private browsing of Chrome Incognito mode, I run into one major problem. The problem is to uncompress Windows 8 crash dump files to memory dumps file with address that <a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/">Volatility</a> Framework can parse. The only tool that can achieve this is is <a href="http://moonsols.com/">moonsols</a> Hibr2Bin and there are only commercial products that I canâ€™t afford. I have to give up from using the result I can collect from Hibernation dump files.</p>

<p>I posted for an alternative solution from fellow DFIR practitioners and an interesting twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AtrHein/status/657079376467464193">conservation</a> started with Volatility Core Developer and Moonsols  Developer. He mentioned that the tool will be open-sourced late 2016 and now it <a href="https://blog.comae.io/your-favorite-memory-toolkit-is-back-f97072d33d5c#.bl3bwdcya">happens</a>!!.</p>

<p>Just fill a form to download the Comae Free Toolkits that includes 2 tools: <em>DumpIt</em> and <em>Hibr2Bin</em>. 
I downloaded it and tested it by dumping the physical memory and it works smoothly.</p>

<p>A very good news for DFIR community!</p>
