I"²<p>This is the pipeline process for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/454_Life_Sciences" page="_blank">454</a> sequencing. I am not a biotech guy but after spending time, giving effort and getting help from my collague, I came up with a way to do that.  The tools I used are <a href="http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software" page="_blank">NCBI SRA Toolkit</a> and 454 sequencing tool for multiplexing.</p>
