I"<p>Gnome terminal is a default terminal application for Ubuntu distro and I love its simplicity and consistency. Iâ€™ve been wondering today that how can I change the color scheme without changing color platte one by one.</p>

<p>My curiosity is fuilfilled by this github repo: <a href="https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized" target="_blank">gnome-terminal-colors-solarized</a>.</p>

<p>Installtion is simple and straightforwards. There is 3 color plattes to choose from.</p>

<p>Hope I can contribute to insert more nice color plattes in the near future.</p>

<p>Updated:
After I look though github repos, I saw several projects related with this and ddecided to make a <a href="https://github.com/aungthurhahein/Colorful-Terminal" target="_blank">curation</a> of them.</p>
