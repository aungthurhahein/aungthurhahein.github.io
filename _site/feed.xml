      What is Apple Universal Control ?

When Apple announced Universal Control, I thought it is too good to be true. A single peripheral device control multiple machines without any setup? That‚Äôs something  peripheral devices manufactures like Logitech are offering with keyboard that can toggle among input devices but not as smoothly as Universal Control can deliver. It‚Äôs a pretty sleek feature that...

      What is DNS Over HTTPs (DoH)?

Standard DNS (on tcp/udp port 53) works just fine but missing security features to prevent tampering of its plaintext DNS request to the DNS providers. It leads to security issues such as DNS Cache Poisoning and typo-squatting domains.

DNS Over HTTPs (DoH) brings TLS/SSL encapsulation on HTTP traffic to boost security integrity issues of spoofing and tampering of...

      I have some down time at this week and decided to reinvent my blog site with new look and organization. This is the first entry after I redesigned and deployed this new site. Throughout the decision making process on the choice of platform and tools, I got some ideas and update to share with you, my friends..

      A look back into 2021, it‚Äôs not the year that I achieve something to proud of. The mental state of mind is not the best and the way that I look into life and the world is changed. The motherland is in turmoil and approaching to become a failed-state. Uncertainty is very high in all citizens, the people who can enjoy their lives with whatever they have. This is far worse than pandemic because th...

      2020 is a tough year for everyone. For me, there is some months like house arrest alone. A year passed by and we are in 2021 with changes in our daily life style and the way we live, work and enjoy life. People are fighting for this virus outbreak but most people believe in our survival instinct and health system.

As for burmese citizens including me, 2021 Feb military coup is another misery a...
