I"6<p>During my master research on Digital Forensic of Data Discovery of Private browsing of Chrome Incognito mode, I run into one major problem. The problem is to uncompress Windows 8 crash dump files to memory dumps file with address that <a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/">Volatility</a> Framework can parse. The only tool that can achieve this is is <a href="http://moonsols.com/">moonsols</a> Hibr2Bin and there are only commercial products that I canâ€™t afford. I have to give up from using the result I can collect from Hibernation dump files.</p>
