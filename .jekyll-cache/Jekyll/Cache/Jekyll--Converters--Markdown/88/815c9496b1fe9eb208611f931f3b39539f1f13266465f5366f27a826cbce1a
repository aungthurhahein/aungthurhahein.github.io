I"¤<p>I read an article about a guyâ€™s concept of making his digital devices to minimalize for the sake of keeping his mind and work-flow simple and straightforward. After I read that, I forgot to keep a bookmark this page and couldnâ€™t find it again. The devices he have are iPad and iPhone. Itâ€™s so simple. He keeps the springboard of both his devices â€œblankâ€. Thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>One thing I still remembers what he replies to others who ask what if you donâ€™t know the name of the application you are looking for. 
He said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you doesnâ€™t remember the name of the application you use, it is not important ones.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the way he thinks and the simple idea he comes up with. I donâ€™t have iOS devices but I believe I can do the same thing with android devices. I get rid of the widgets and frustrating stuffs from my home screen for both my phone and kindle fire.</p>
