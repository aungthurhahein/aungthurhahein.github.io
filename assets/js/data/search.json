As an avid productivity explorer, I read a good amount of them, and most of them definitely deliver useful messages to the audience. If I have to pick 3 books that most people can apply to their daily work and lives, it narrows down the following 3 books that have practical methods and approaches to tackle our personal and work lives.Please keep in mind that these books are not labeled as the BEST productivity books. I considered them as a decent practical knowledge shared by authors, built on their own personal experience and learning to master the techniques.Please keep in mind that these books are not labeled as the BEST productivity books. I considered them as a decent practical knowledge shared by authors, built on their own personal experience and learning to master the techniques.GRIP - The Art of Working SmartI never think too much about how we should organize our work, from daily task planning to mega-project management. It’s more about personal preference and copying each other at work without consideration of how things should be done effectively. This book dives into the resources and concepts of how we can tackle tasks systematically in today digital workforce. If you have to pick ONLY 1 book, I recommend this book 100%.The bottom line of the book is that we should learn how to organize and work as a class in school, and this book fulfills that knowledge gap, at least for me.Building a 2nd BrainI never gave serious consideration to taking notes and capturing information before I read this book. A hint of the idea of 2nd brain is mentioned briefly in GRIP by Rick Pastoor to reflect that hoarding information and tasks in your head distracts us from focusing on productivity. Tiago Forte discovers the systematic approach of note taking to build our personal backup brain and focus on the execution of tasks at hand.Tiago Forte runs a great YouTube channel with all the tips and extracts from his book. His 2nd brain tour brings in creators’ adaptations of their productivity systems and their insights on 2nd brain concept. Check it out!Make TimeThe authors of the book clearly mentioned that the book is not about boosting productivity. The book covers the ideology of finding balance in a chaotic world and how to manage our work and lives loosely. The concept of finding a sweet spot between our daily robotic default plans and long-term goals to find a “highlight” makes sense for our sanity check.Personal InsightsThere is no ideal system for anyone. Our lives and the drives that made us move forward are different. In my opinion, the best approach is to discover and reflect on what works for us and adjust it with the techniques and principles we learned from a variety of resources. OK..you might think when we know the system is working. The fact that you are happier, have more free time for yourself and your family, have less mental stress, and get things done will be the KPIs to measure the system that is working for us.It doesn’t need to be perfect. We just need to pay attention to find the best solution for our lives. As Ramit Sethi’s well-known financial advice called “Rich Life”, the same applies when it comes down to productivity. It’s about what’s working, making us move, and reaching our goals." }, { "title": "Free Useful AI model based Tools in 2023", "url": "/posts/AITools/", "categories": "Notes, Productivity", "tags": "productivity, LLM", "date": "2023-06-26 11:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "In 2023, we are witnessing a fast-growing market of value-added services on top of AI models, thanks in part to the availability of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to the public.

It’s a recommended course for anyone who wants to improve their systematic thinking and learn how to think better.Section 3 of the course is about systems thinking, and I am trying to understand how to apply these thinking approaches to daily life. The blog post from Ryan Delaney called Systems Thinking Examples In Everyday Life gave me some ideas on how to apply it to my career in the cybersecurity field.This blog post is an attempt to reflect on applying systems thinking as a solution for securing digital assets from adversaries.What is Systems Thinking in briefSystems thinking is a holistic approach to problem-solving that focuses on understanding how different components of a system interact with each other and how they contribute to the overall performance of the system.In today’s interconnected world, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. The traditional approach to cybersecurity often focuses on individual components, such as firewalls or antivirus software. However, a more effective and comprehensive strategy is to apply systems thinking to cybersecurity.By understanding the interconnectedness of various components and their impact on the overall system, we can develop a holistic approach to protecting our digital assets.The main components, impact factors and their interaction in CybersecurityApplication of Systems Thinking on CyberSecurity domainIdentifying InterdependenciesIn a cybersecurity context, it is crucial to identify the interdependencies between various components. For example, a vulnerability in one system can have a ripple effect on other interconnected systems. By understanding these interdependencies, we can assess the potential impact of a security breach and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risks.Analyzing Feedback LoopsSystems thinking also involves analyzing feedback loops within the cybersecurity system. Feedback loops can be either reinforcing or balancing. Reinforcing feedback loops amplify the effects of a particular event, while balancing feedback loops help maintain stability. By identifying and understanding these feedback loops, we can develop strategies to strengthen the reinforcing loops and address any imbalances.Considering the Human FactorAn essential aspect of systems thinking applied to cybersecurity is recognizing the role of human behavior in the system. Humans can be both the weakest link and the strongest defense in cybersecurity. Understanding how human actions and decisions affect the security of the system allows us to develop effective training programs, policies, and procedures to minimize human-related vulnerabilities.Collaboration and information sharingSystems thinking also emphasizes collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders. Cybersecurity is not just an individual responsibility but a collective effort. By fostering collaboration between organizations, sharing threat intelligence, and promoting best practices, we can collectively enhance the security of the entire system.Risk Management StrategySystems thinking can help organizations develop a comprehensive risk management strategy that takes into account all potential threats and vulnerabilities. This involves identifying potential risks and assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk. By doing so, organizations can prioritize their security efforts and allocate resources effectively.Continuous ImprovementSystems thinking also involves continuous monitoring and improvement of the security system. This means regularly reviewing the effectiveness of security controls and processes, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes as necessary.https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Systems_ThinkingOverall, applying systems thinking to cybersecurity can help organizations develop a comprehensive and effective security strategy that takes into account the interconnectedness of different security controls, processes, and technologies. By doing so, organizations can better protect their assets and respond to the evolving cyber threats that they face.I recommend the website called The System Thinker to learn more of the use cases, tools and how to become an excel system thinker." }, { "title": "Boost Productivity with These Tools in 2023", "url": "/posts/productivity-2023/", "categories": "Notes, Productivity", "tags": "productivity, 2nd Brain", "date": "2023-06-11 10:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "I am avid enthusiast of productivity hack and wrote a few pieces over the past years on my productivity system and how to connect the digital apps that I used in a daily basis. This past few weeks, I discovered an approach that have been talking over productivity hack YouTuber and creators about building a backup or 2nd brain and the implementation of it. This post is to highlight my findings and practical tips that might help you in your system.2nd brain aka Backup brainI stumbled upon a productivity YouTube clip and recalled the idea from GRIP by Rick Pastoor called backup brain. Tiago Forte used the term 2nd brain in a similar concept in the book with a more deep-dive in the implementation and application of it. The fundamental idea is to store information that we gathered in a daily basis in visual, audio format instead of trying to remember it, which is not impossible to do.After spending sometimes to research on it and reflecting on it, I decided to update a simpler and more effective productivity system for ME. The hardest part is to strip down tools and customizing the workflow that suits my needs.ReadWise + Reader AppI was a big fan of Matter2 due to its ability to extract newsletter and rss feeds from gmails and staff picked posts are intriguing to read. After a pay wall is introduced, it becomes more of a typical book marking site for Freemium users. The discovery of ReadWise app is a breakthrough for me. It gathers your digital note taking and highlights into a single source to incubate ideas and thoughts. The Reader app from ReadWise is still in beta as this moment and it shows great potential and i am using Reader to complement ReadWise and plug in to my productivity system.Eliminate Tons of Nested FoldersIn every apps i use such as OneNote, Apple Note and File systems, I like to keep way too complicated folder structure that impossible to keep track or use it after a while. Instead of forcing to assign folders, I found that all notes starts as a quick note and assign to folders afterwards make it more organized. The 2nd brain guy suggests of a PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources and Archives) method also works well in some cases.Bullet JournalI replaced analog bullet journal with Notion to schedule and track with several Notion views and it’s working well. The only downside is the synchronization with my work and personal calendar. I am still thinking of a way to merge Calendar App and Notion somehow.Daily Journal to notion via emailI used to jot down daily journal in a free form format into a notebook and I keep skipping doing that. I created a reminder and create a flow to send email to IFTTT that registers a new entry to Notion template. Along the way of creating this flow, I started using Apple default dictation feature when I am too tired or lazy to type. It is working quite nice and adapting to the way I love.How the final system look likeWork and Personal life information flow is still segregated, which is not ideal to continue what I left off. I want to use Notion instead of One Note for work but still unable to use it due to access control policy.Fundamental Digital Organization StackCalendar is a cockpit to view time sensitive tasks and meetings for work and personal tasks. I use it side-by-side with Notion Bullet Journal and other project trackers to view upcoming tasks and prioritization of things to achieve in a daily basis. Apple Note is one of the underrated note app that suitable for anyone who are in Apple ecosystem. Reminders is mostly for daily reminder,weekly reminder of recurring tasks and to-do lists.Reading and Knowledge Consumption WorkflowReadwise becomes an interesting find for me and it replaces some of the apps i use for bookmarking, highlighting and RSS reader. Kindle eBook reader and Apple Book are 2 main apps I used to read books and articles along with Readwise reader. Some highlights and articles are feed into Notion to turn into blog posts and to build a high-fidelity knowledge base of subjects that I want to learn more.Audio and Video ConsumptionBookplayer is a good source to listen to audio books and any audio files that you have in your system. It supports for entire Apple Ecosystem and I just love to listen to audiobooks during the commute via CarPlay.AI AppsThe recent breakthrough of OpenAI’s chatGPT has paved the way for hundreds of new AI apps designed to improve productivity. Some of my personal favorites include PPoe, Magical and Otter AI. I prefer Poe over chatGPT because of its ability to create custom bots with prompts. As we look towards the future, it’s clear that AI will play an increasingly important role in productivity workflows. With potential for AI-embedded apps, we can expect to see a fusion of digital productivity tools that are more efficient and customizable than ever before.Behind the scenes: AutomationI was a long time users of IFTTT but it is almost unusable without going through its paywall. I was exploring Zapier at this moment but let see.To conclude, the main improvement point is our habits and the approaches we took in capturing records of what we learned every days into a personal knowledge base. That will be the primary exploration that I’ll try to uplift this year.Stay creative, productive and efficient year ahead, everyone." }, { "title": "ChatGPT Use Cases for CyberSecurity Folks", "url": "/posts/chatgpt/", "categories": "Security, AI", "tags": "CyberSecurity, AI, ChatGPT", "date": "2023-04-12 01:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "A Recap on ChatGPT and AlternativesCurrently, there are numerous ChatGPT and alternative NLP-based technologies available, such as Anthropic, GPT-3, and WebGPT. The list of more than 600 apps can be found at gpt3demo, and it continues to grow. A few I personally used are Poe by Quora, Perplexity, AI21 Labs and Flowrite. I wrote this piece in a way of exploring how this NLP technology can assist in daily workflows for cybersecurity practitioners.Prompts?I do not maintain like prompt library for tasks but if you are interested and looking for ideas, FlowGPT and Awesome-ChatGPT-Prompts is a good start. A simple prompt to hint to act or assign a specific role before other queries works for me.A Lazy prompt but work ok..All examples in this blog post is used ChatGPT 3.5 turbo engine by Poe. The reasons I used Poe over OG ChatGPT or other bots are built-in multiple bots with different NLP engine and custom bot creation. This is the custom prompt I used for my cybersecurity theme bot:I want you to act as a cyber security specialist. I will ask questions and tasks related with CyberSecurity and you can assist me with decision making process and give me insights. This could include suggesting encryption methods, creating firewalls or implementing policies that mark certain activities as suspicious, analyzing security incidents, analyzing vulnerability, proposing remediation and mitigation actions, code review and analyzing code snippets.Any suggestions or improvements to this prompt is welcome.Personalized Search EngineChatGPT can be used as a search engine for learning new concepts and ideas related to cybersecurity. It can help practitioners stay up to date with the latest trends and developments in the field.I found out that ChatGPT can give a textbook style answer for a simple queries but it is refusing to give answer for an example or actual script or payload that can be used for malicious intent. Some people might already abused this somehow, I guess.Reverse vs Forward Shell..Assisting with decision making and reasoning as a consultantAnother good use of ChatGPT for cybersecurity domain is treating it as your colleague and security consultant that can support in tactical and strategic ideas of the problems and solutions that complicated to perform. It gives a robotic answer and not useful 100% but you can get a lead from it and use it as inputs with your own guidance.Attack Surface Reduction Strategy IdeasIR PlaybookSupporting in technical tasksChatGPT can be used to automate technical tasks such as vulnerability scanning, patch management, and threat hunting. It can also assist with network monitoring and analysis and provide insights into potential security vulnerabilities. By analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns, ChatGPT can help cybersecurity practitioners detect and respond to threats in a more efficient and effective manner.ChatGPT also can assist with incident response by providing real-time insights and recommendations during a security incident. It can help practitioners quickly identify the root cause of an incident and take appropriate action to mitigate the impact.This is one area that the bot can perform better than other use cases. The following tasks that you can throw into ChatGPT for initial analysis that save your time:Source Code InterpretationI am surprised that it gives line-by-line interpretation of the code but may not work for some low-levl PLsCode Review for security issueA summary of the isuses found from both synatax and semantic error and also security issues.Initial query creation for SIEM, Regex and EDRIt can be a better option than uncoder.io at this point IMOAutomation Script Generationfirst part of the job is to create a script for log collectiona follow-up query to create a wrapper script to cron scheduleScript and Program GenerationA simple HTTP server setup with Python modulesCreate detection signatures such as Yara, Snort, Sigma and so onYara signature is collecting from OSNIT and vendor blogs. This shows a potential use cases for Intel analystsSigma rule but I am not sure the conditions actually work or not.Using it to fasten GRC tasksOne use case for ChatGPT in the cybersecurity field is to fasten GRC (excel) jobs, such as risk assessments and compliance reporting. By automating the process and providing insights into potential risks and compliance issues, ChatGPT can save practitioners valuable time and resources. Additionally, ChatGPT can help with documentation and knowledge sharing, making it easier for team members to understand and communicate technical concepts and ideas.It doesnt align with NIST 800–30 suggested tempalte 100% but good enough for a starterI’ll say this is more of an outline boilerplate that you can kickstart for actual organization specific policiesReportingFinally, ChatGPT can be used to improve communication and collaboration within the cybersecurity team. It can assist with documentation and knowledge sharing and help team members better understand and communicate technical concepts and ideas.I feed the DFIR 2022 Yearly Review and request to summarize a vanilla version of it. It is a bit blunt and robotic but not bad though.I need more inputs to find out how good this summary can goOther Interesting Security ChatGPT ProjectsMicrosoft is announcing co-pilot for automating and including ChatGPT capability into Incident response, threat hunting and reporting tasks but we don’t know it going to be accessible for all users or not.Burpgpt is a plugin for burp suite to assist with web application security testing. The tool uses the GPT-3 model to generate a list of potential attack payloads and suggest test cases for specific vulnerabilities identified during a web application security assessment. The tool can also be used to generate context-specific content for phishing and social engineering attacks.In the near future, security vendors and open source projects will utilize ChatGPT capability. I believe that it will assist and cope with tedious tasks in security operation and management." }, { "title": "Cyber Security Hygiene Tips for Individuals at 2023", "url": "/posts/security2023/", "categories": "Security, Threat", "tags": "Guide, CyberSecurity, Threat", "date": "2023-02-05 10:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "As a threat intel lead and riding all sort of new incidents in the past year, there is a change of attack vectors from adversary and cyber-criminals. The focus changes to human factors than complicated technical exploits which is a challenge for organizations to control. The purpose of this piece is to provide 8 highlights of what the individuals can focus to improve security hygiene and footprints on the internet.MFA Everything2022 is full of incidents pivoting around MFA bypass and social engineering attempts towards MFA token to breach into the system. Still, this is still a layer of defense from a bad guy from getting your legitimate credentials. Check all your software services and ENABLE MFA without any 2nd thought. When we are talking about Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), there are 3 factors; what you know (password, PIN), what you have (security key, mobile phone auth token), and who you are (biometrics). A mix of at least 2FA or 3FA can prevent you from falling your valuable credentials into a bad guy, that leads into a major data breach.Invest on Password ManagerMany people have more than a dozen web services and passwords that we used for it. It’s a bad idea to use the same key for all of them. It’s like you have 1 key that can open a front door to your house and a vault that keeps your valuables. It’s hard to remember and keep these Keys in a safe but accessible place. Do your research and choose a password manager but may not recommended LastPass due to its major data breach in 2022.Monitor your email address from credential breachYour personal or business email address are used for logging into may services. It is also likely to use as out-of-band authentication by some services such as an option to send out 2FA token. If your email with valid credentials is fell into a breach database in darkweb, it is a good exercise to reset password along with the other services that used the same password. For these reasons, it is a good idea to monitor your email address using website like HaveIBeenPwned or alerting from Firefox Monitor.Invest on security key fobMFA makes user experience low but maintain good account security. FIDO Alliance proposes a new way to secure login with a good user experience by utilizing built-in security factors from your device such as biometrics and a security key fob that you can plugin or NFA to your deice and approve with a tap. The web services that supporting this new protocols is growing fast. Based on my personal experience. this is way faster and more convenient than punching 6 digits OTP token, SMS tokens and so on.Stay Away from BadwaresIf you want to save money and want to download pirated software and games from piratebay or other shady websites, please think twice. The consequences can be devastating since most of these software is modified with info-stealers and key-loggers that tracking your activities on the compromised deices. Basically, there is a chance of your credentials, credit card information and bank account can end up in another guy’s hand. The same applies for mobile apps and ONLY download apps from recognized repositories like Google Play or Apple Store.Start using Egress Network MonitoringI use a host-based firewall on my MacBook called Lulu. It is free and shout out to the developer, it is awesome. The best time to install is it after your OS is in a clean slate. Drop Lulu and whitelist the connections. Afterwards, all new connections are prompted for a quick review to allow or block. In case of unknown outgoing traffic, we can assume it as a malware of info-stealer tryting to establish conenction to its Command-and-Control (C2) server. It’s a bit annoying at first but can get used to it sooner or later. I found some Windows host-based Firewalls but can’t recommend due to lack of personal experience on these.Avoid using devices with No Regular Security PatchesThere are new vulnerabilities found by security researchers and adversary in a daily basis. At one point, legacy operating systems reach End of Life (EoL) and not going to receive any security patches. If we are still using these devices for processing sensitive applications such as mobile banking, there is a chance that adversary targeting these vulnerabilities can bypass control to gain access. So, better recycle these legacy devices or only use that don’t process sensitive information.Understand Common Social Engineering TacticsThere are few common social engineering tactics used by attackers from phishing emails, SMS phishing, and luring you to become an insider threat of your organization with fake promises. Another trend in 2022 is OTP prompt bombing to you until you click ‘accept’ from plain frustration or to stop the annoyance. Be careful and think twice before approving or interacting something that out of your typical workflow. If there is impersonation of individuals in your organization and not certain of the request, call to check with the person directly. There is even approach of these fraudsters calling directly to your work line to request for installing malware or remote access software. These fraudsters are well trained and can speak native language.These are some of the top concerns to improve your footprint and risk of being a victim of cyber attacks based on my observations from incidents from 2022. Stay safe and don’t be a patient zero that leads to compromise yourself, and your belonged organizations. Hope you find something useful in this piece." }, { "title": "InfoStealer Malware & How to AVOID them", "url": "/posts/infostealer/", "categories": "Security, Threat", "tags": "InfoStealer, CyberSecurity, Threat", "date": "2022-11-25 11:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "A recent report from Group-IB describes that Russian hackers have stolen over 50 millions passwords in the first 7 months of 2022 using info stealer malware. The evolution and development of Information Stealer Malware in 2022 is intrusive and there are many variants of infoStealer malware targeting from mobile to desktop operating systems. This is still a prominent threat in upcoming years and this post is a study of infoStealer malware capability and common observed characteristics for remediation and awareness of it.What is Information Stealer Malware?The goal of InfoStealer malware is to exfiltrate user sensitive information such as access credentials, financial information and Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from user mobile and desktop devices. Based on the success and the scope of the attack campaign, some of these infoStealer malware are more popular than others such as Raccoon Stealer and Redline Stealer.Even though the implementation of these malware is varied, the initial attack vector and distribution of malware lies on Social Engineering techniques. Phishing Attacks are surprisingly still effective way to compromise devices and use of legitimate software with side-loaded malware capability is also another approaches used by adversaries.OK..Where does the stolen INFORMATION go?The end-user who is compromised by InfoStealer are unlikely to face any service disruption and irregularity in the devices they are using. The exfiltrated stolen information goes to sale on underground marketplace and access brokers and the potential buyers can be indiviaul attackers to ransomware group. That depends on the value of the information such as type of accounts and systems that can access with the leaked credentials. For people who would like to understand more of the “traffers” ecosystem, I recommend to read a post from Sekoia.The recent breach on Uber is a good fresh example of how a simple account leak ends up into a publicized major incident that costs huge damage to the organization.InfoStealer Malware EcosystemThe generic attack flow used by InfoStealer Malware is pretty simple. The initial attack vector is targeted to individuals via social engineering techniques with some innovative approaches to side-load and deploy the actual malware into the devices. Afterwards, the harvesting of information can target from web browser sessions to chat messages and forward it back to attacker collection servers. After data processing and a database of stolen records, it is listed to auction or sale to multiple buyers at underground markets.InfoStealer Malware Attack Flow SimplifiedThe impact of this stolen information differs from the uses of the buyers and its motives. If the buyer is the ransomware operator and credentials can access to privileged systems and environment of a major enterprise organization, the business can be devastated like Uber incident.What Individuals can do to PREVENT it?At organization level, this is one of the threats focus to remediate by security team, however individuals need to understand the depth of the risk and how it can impact greatly to organization wide. The prevention of the security team cannot go beyond organization network and user own devices and it is a big challenge and privacy concerns to monitor and provision personal devices.From the study of the stealers, the primary targeted platform is Windows and Android Operating Systems. There is a trend of hijacking browser session and logging login credentials of users keystroke by manipulating javascript input escalates the threat to another level.The following is some of the tips to minimize the threats of InfoStealer: THINK twice before you enter your credentials and sensitive information request from unfamiliar web sites. Don’t CLICK anything on emails with unknown subjects and sender. Don’t REUSE passwords, especially the ones for financial services and high-privileged accounts for Enterprise Infra Access such as VPN and PAM accounts. STOP using softwares and mobile apps from illegitimate app repositories. Use Egress network filtering to capture and block unknown traffic. If possible, use Segeration of devices for personal and cooperate use. Pause and think before you allow photo editor app requesting for SMS message read permission.To sum up, this is observed as one of the biggest threat in this year and upcoming year(s). Organization security teams are fighting this threat to remediate. However, individuals need to aware of the threats can lead to a disaster not only for yourself, but also to the organization you are attributed to." }, { "title": "MacOS Stage Manager and My Expectations for the next Update", "url": "/posts/stage-manager/", "categories": "Tech, MacOS", "tags": "MacOS, Apple", "date": "2022-11-17 09:15:00 +0700", "snippet": "From a super user comes from Windows 95 to 10 and a variety of Linux Window manager from GUI to tiling Window Manager, I put myself as slightly above average level in terms of understanding in desktop window organization.When I started using MacOS 3 years ago, my frustration with a dozen of floating apps and almost impossible to point out a particular app I am looking for is a bummer. Window 10 introduces multiple desktops, which is awesome way to organize desktop by logical grouping. My first desktop will be browser, 2nd desktop will be apps related with work (email, one note, MS Teams) and 3rd one for focus work group (for writing report, serious focus works and music). Toggling around these 3 desktops minimize my “finding Nemo” in the 10 opened apps significantly.When I heard about this Stage Manager features introduced in MacOS Ventura, I am happy that this gonna improves organization and productivity. However, after a month pass on with turning on and off and I starts feeling like a tester than a user of this feature. For people who never use this before, this is the brief summary of what Stage Manager does: You can group opened apps into groups by pressing “shift” key and drag and drop. You can do snapping window to resize and still need 3rd party apps like Rectangle to do the job. You can drag apps back to the thumbnail strip at the left side to ungroup. Ctrl-H to hide apps from Stage Manager but still can find at the dock. Ctrl-M to minimize the app to thumbnail strip without moving to another group.Confused? Go read Apple instructions and which is more or less confusing as what I describes above. You gonna need a bit of trial and error to get a hand-on. In my opinion, Apple should think of a more complete solution than this app grouping. Here is the some of the suggestions as an end-user for the next update of this feature: Snapping 2 or more apps to create group by default (skipping the shift key and dragging one by one) Introduces default key bindings to snap and resize apps (just make Rectangle snapping key maps by default) Mission Control should follow the same layouts and grouping of apps as the thumbnails, otherwise it is still a messy user experience and back to “finding Nemo” Option to create app groups in thumbnails into a new window or move to existing window at mission control (This might probably depends with point #3) When Opening a new application, the existing center focused app is minimized immediately instead of grouping. At this point, overlaying apps is more plausible than taking over existing focused app.This is just purely based on my personal requirement of a user preferring key bindings over drag and drop style. From the people who loves drag-and-drop, most of the points I mention might not be a big issue.

I went to Amazon store to check books under Threat Intel &amp; Hunting domains. There is not a lot of options as other Cybersecurity domains, especially in the ones published recent years. I got a wild idea of buying a bunch of them to read through to review the content of the books and the ideas. This is a brief review of these books for anyone who wants to purchase to read it. My main job responsibility is taking care of threat landscape and input to risk management. The reviews are given to reflect which level of knowledge required for each books and content coverage.Just for a sanity check and unbiased judgement, I don’t have any of these authors’ works and pick these books with ZERO effort in reading other reviews.A mix of both domainsThis is the first book I read back in 2021 and a technical oriented content with practical examples and tools that the beginner level can kick start threat intelligence and hunting tasks. However, this book might not be relevant in near future with new tools and technology available. If you want to have hand-on knowledge and how to use tools such as MITRE CAR, CALDERA, &amp; Atomic Red Team, this is a good book to start with. Level: Beginner Content: Technical Recommended Reader: technical person that wants a basic introduction of threat intel/hunting and some of the - tools to perform the tasks Published Date: February 2021Threat IntelligenceThis books layout in an interesting way for the reader to understand not only about Threat Intelligence with practical tools and execution, but also walk through incident response procedure, DFIR concepts and how Threat Intel can support throughout investigation steps. Level: Beginner to Intermediate Content: Technical and Procedural Recommended Reader: technical person that wants to dive into Incident Response and Threat Intelligence. Published Date: May 2022Probably, this is one of the best book that covers foundation of threat intel, threat actor campaigns, threat intel lifecycle with examples. The book sits in a good balance between technical, theoretical and operational aspect of how to start a proper intel program for enterprises. A recommended book if you want to invest on ONLY 1 book to have a gist of threat intelligence. Level: Beginner to Intermediate Content: Technical and Theoretical Recommended Reader: Anyone who works in SOC, CERT and risk management and my recommendation if you ONLY want 1 book to cover Intel lifecycle Published Date: June 2022The book has academic style layout and presentation that highlights the past severe incidents and how Threat Intel plays a role in preventing it. If you are already in the industry and not seeking detailed technical explanation of protocols and how the attacks layout, this book is a bit over-killed. I wish I read something like this last 5 years ago. Each chapter topics are not quite coherent and presents a new topic. Level: Intermediate to advance Content: Theoretical Recommended Reader: technical person that wants to dive into Published Date: 2018The book content is not designed for procedural level of “hows”. it explains what is Threat Intelligence program and the benefits of it. It also walks through intel life cycle and other important ‘must know’ topics such as analytic frameworks and techniques. Level: Beginner to Intermediate Content: Managerial Recommended Reader: anyone who wants to understand the importance of threat intel program and from managerial aspects Published Date: 2021Another good book with dive-in practical approach to establish intel program and how to turn into actions. The book is not long and covers most aspects that need for consideration to kick start. For a guy with technical background, I found this book easy to swallow and the use of diagrams and pictures saves a ton of words. Some idea, the author uses a odd analogy but it kind of stick in your brain. Level: Beginner to Intermediate Content: Technical and Procedural Recommended Reader: anyone who wants to tailor intel process and practical methods to execute but needs some ideas Published Date: March 2018Threat HuntingThe first book under Threat Hunting that I decided to read is “The Foundations of Threat Hunting”. It’s a theoretical book that dive into the process of how to establish threat hunting program of the organization. The needs of people, process. technology and management approval is layout nicely with good scenarios. A very good book for team lead or even technical personnel to understand the core principles and concepts of Threat Hunting Program. Level: Intermediate Content: management and non-technical concepts for team formation and program establishment Recommended Reader: Team lead or managerial position that wants to understand the value and requirements of Threat Hunting Program Published Date: June 2022The 2nd and 19th chapter of this book have a special place in my mind as the author reflects his or her own personal experience in digging underground threat actors’ motive with cover profile and actual conversation examples with the path he took. The rest of the book is heavily cover on tooling and techniques for OSINT. It can be a good holiday read for some hardcore OSINT guy that wanna dive into another level down. Level: Intermediate to Advanced Content: Technical Recommended Reader: The investigators and analysts on the ground hunting and tracking e-criminals Published Date: 2020I don’t know who is Dan Borges but he is a philosophical security guy. He describes things in a non-fiction way, which is quite intriguing for some deep level thinkers but might be a throw-off for practical guys. I suggests you gives a preview read at Amazon or somewhere before purchasing it.The book covers paradigms and aspects to understand in theoretical level of cybersecurity attack and defense “competitions”(actual terms used by author). Level: Intermediate to Advanced Content: Theoretical Recommended Reader: For L4 analysts or threat hunters that want to advance and align with modern state of the warfare Published Date: June 2021Other books I read in the past and found usefulI don’t want to list any books that can be vendor basis but this book gives me a solid background for my understanding of threat intel domain and applications for different security functions. The latest release is 4th edition and a lot of fine-tune and upDate to catch up.It is also FREE with an exchange of your contact information, so the affiliated vendor can contribute to your mail inbox with emails about how the platform can make you a ninja.TaHiTI Threat Hunting methodology is my choice of threat hunting approach and this free available resource from Dutch financial institutions bring me joy and kick start of a systematic approach on performing routine threat hunts.Any of your favorite books missing out in the above list? I want to know.

About a week ago, I got an idea of utilizing it as a 2nd phone and thinking of a purpose for it. My primary work and personal-ish phone is iPhone and it is a usual iPhone with tons of notifications from emails, work messages and a lot of junk messages. It like to ruin my weekends and personal time by seeing information that I planned for near future.I bought iPad mini for media consumption and reading short forms but it still bloating with information that I don’t want to know intentionally due to unavoidable notifications.So, I came up with a purpose for that android phone as a “focus” phone. This piece is to walk-through my setup on the UI, settings and philosophy behind it.Light Phone but a bit heavierThe purpose or objectives of this “focus” phone is similar to LightPhone but a more practical approach. Light Phone is a great idea but e-ink screen is not responsive and B&amp;W screen is not good for use cases like navigation and tailoring user needs since there is no app store. 299$ price tag is a bit shocking as well.I don’t believe in these so-called “dumb” phone. Nobody needs these legacy phones. If you have a problem with your phone usage, you improve yourself. The machines is not the problem. The problem is yourself. By having these legacy phones and trying to survive in this modern world, it’s wasting more time and becomes a dumb phone to time-wasting phone with no satisfaction on your digital consumption.For internet access, I have a free SIM from my internet provider that I don’t use it for anything and it’s just perfect for this use case. If the dimension of the phone size is less than 6 inches, it can be better to carry around since you likely to have 2 phones in some cases. The phone I used is Honor 10, a decent performance as of the time of writing.This is the list of objectives that I drafted to set up the phone:Nah List No Messaging app No Media and streaming apps such as Netflix, Twitch… (Basically, No apps that generates audio and videos) No Games except if it helps you learn something No widgets Limitation on Social Media app (I failed and still have twitter for catching up news) Minimal UI to limit “phubbing” and avoid opening apps that you are not planning to Get rid of android bloatwares somehow (hiding it or uninstalling it) NO work related apps in there Don’t use this mobile number to receive junk SMS (promo, offers, coupons) Don’t subscribe any SaaS services to reduce notificationsAye List It can make calls and have internet access (obviously). Navigation apps Short form reading oriented apps for productivity boost and learning something new on the toilet or break time Pomodoro timer app to use during work hours Tasks list for big goals of the day Some utility apps such as Optimizer and Mono tone solid color background to remind yourself that this phone is not funTime for some technicalApart from that, I change configurations on saving battery life by disabling bluetooth, NFC, GPS. Schedule the phone to sleep when I sleep and wake up when I wake up. Again, nobody is expecting to call this phone. It saves your battery and charging frequency reduces at least 2 fold. I also disable notification on both lock and home screen.The most time I spend on is replacing Android stock launcher with minimal ones. I am surprised to find out there are many launchers to choose from. I landed into 3 launchers from reading this post at TechWiser, which are Indistractable Launcher (inspired by LightPhone), LessPhone (also LightPhone inspired), and Takan launcher.After toggling around these 3 launchers, I decided to spend 3$ on Indistractable launcher as a winner. It is just right for me. Full text listing of apps without icons reduces on UX and I applied I set up with arcticons icon pack and the following is the outcome of this whole journey:Apps TimeThere can be your go-to apps for productivity, reading and so on. This is the list of apps I installed it after uninstalling and hiding a surprising amount of apps. Forest App for pomodoro timer News app from Microsoft and Google Medium, of course Twitter for guilty pleasure Deepstash for learning new ideas and thoughtsThat’s it pretty much with some default apps such as note, maps and utility apps.OK Bro, When you gonna use this phone?At the first few weeks, I still lean into my regular phone most of the time. I started with building a minor habit by bring this phone to read during a toilet time. These short breaks are hard to read something long. I normally don’t have my kindle ready at office toilet and iPad is over-killed. I switched to this focus phone to read something on it.During my working hours, I use forest app to pomodoro logging with a vibration setting. The rest if typically stuffs as making calls and taking pictures of notes and things. I started to carry this phone around during weekends instead of my primary phone. It’s a bit paranoid with many “what if” questions. Of course, there are missed calls and messages but I didn’t run into any life and death situation so far. Let see how does it go.Final thoughtsFrom these experimental weeks, I read more stuffs and can relax without notification bomb all the time. I can relax around my room with less distractions and can read and enjoy personal time better. When I want to check news or catch up the world, my focus phone fulfills the needs. Some drawbacks from this 2 phone system. I have to carry 2 phones and have to make a decision like should i leave my primary phone or not. It’s annoying but I believe I can adjust it very soon.I hope you found something useful from my focus phone journey and adapt to your personal goals.

In the core fundamentals, there are several ideas and principles that can make you fit and have a above average longevity. Japanese are known for their health and lifestyle that leads to over 100 years life expectancy. They don’t do cross-fit or follow a complicated fitness regime. However, they stays healthy and live longer than most people around the world according to several studies.The post is not to promote Japanese lifestyle, however I’ve been thinking some good pointers that everyone can follow to have a sustainable lifestyle with less effort that can make your body healthier and less stressful.I am not a fitness instructor or life couch and not certified for anything related to this topic. Just a guy trying to stay fit and picking it up good healthy methods from people who knows better than me on this subject. I sort of realize that it is more than hitting a gym to have a healthy body and mind. This post is a sanity check of a layman reflecting on fitness and health. It can leads to controversial topics and I am welcome to know your thoughts.MoveThe first mission objective is to move yourself. Do chores, take a walk, walk your dogs, climb a stair and don’t be a couch potato. If you have a lifestyle that locks you into a chair or workstation, a timely reminder to get up and walk for 1 mins or 2.If you go to gym, good for you. If you exercise outdoor, that’s great. I’ve seen people who willing to sacrifice half hours in the climbing stairs but complaining to use a normal stair. It kind of ironic and open your mind. If you spend 5 hours in a gym, nothing happens. The main thing that matter is your consistency and frequency. Move more. Active more and enjoy what you love to do. A person who hate running, don’t run. Do something you love. It can be a walk, a swim. No time or money to go to gym, you are not the only ones. Explore home exercises and basic movements like push-ups, hanging, plunks and jumping jacks, yoga makes you fitter and stronger day by day.Eat LessWe eat way too much that we need. It becomes a routine. Breakfast, followed by lunch, snacks and dinner. It’s ok to eat 3 times a day but east less. Imagine that you eat 5000 kcal for day and your body calories surplus at the end of the day is way too high, you will gain weight and it can leads to other complicated issues. Eat slow and stop at 60 to 80% what you normally eat. It’s a pleasure to enjoy a delicious meal and snacks, but eating more than what your body requires is not a healthy choice. Your body will used to it to eat less after you starts practicing in a week or two.Intermittent FastingLet’s say in 2000 years ago, I don’t think humans eat 3 times a day to survive. We go hunting and probably a feast and the next time, it can be a empty stomach day. Modern lifestyle leads to continuous eating throughout the day and your body have to burn and process whatevery you put in. No time to rest. I have no breakfast, a lunch and 1 mini-dinner instead of 3 big meals a day for 6 months and still alive. Lose 8 kgs with moderate amount of exercise and feel good. No craving most of the time. It doesn’t imply that everyone should eat 1 meal. Listen to your body and don’t eat when you are not hungry. It’s not a mandatory and your body will damage if you don’t eat. It’s the other way around and make you healthier surprisingly.If you guys want to give intermittent fasting, give it a go. Have a portion of 7-8 hours as a eating zone and stop eating food after that. Your body generates ketone which helps in fat loss and weight control. Another plus side is you save money and time since you are cutting a meal or two out of your daily routine.Eat Good FoodI was just done my annual health checkup. The overall result is good but HDL Cholesterol is lower than reference range for my age. From a consulation with doctor, it seems my diet is lack of “good fat”, which can be found in olive oil, purple fruits and omega-3 products like fish oils and fatty fish.Weight yourself everydayInvest on a simple scale for measuring your weight everyday. I weigh myself everyday as the first thing when i woke up after #1 and/or 2. It gives you the closest measure of your actual weight and keep you reflect on your food intake and control for today.Find Your MotivatorWhen I starts exercising, I am seeking a way to motivate myself for sticking to the exercise routines. It can be anything that helps you motivate to move around and stay active. My motivator is Apple Watch that sets daily goal, challenges with friends and rings. Other motivators can be your gym buddies, trainer and a sensation of outdoor sceneries. Find the motivator and make your activity enjoyable and fun.However, it is a waste of time on not focusing your activity and carry away with the distractions like playing mobile games during the gym and watching a movie. I don’t see a good outcome in this multi-tasking. Work out with focus and get it done. You can enjoy your movies fullly.Periodic Medical CheckupIf you are healthy, your appearance and skin tells a part of it. However, we still need to understand how our critical organs are functioning well and what is wrong with our diets and nutrimental requirements reach to the ideal portion. The worst scenario is to spot the diseases in advance and organ failure before it is beyond recovery. The periodic medical checkup is important whether it is cover in your medical insurance or not. Invest on it and compare with historical records to understand your “body performance”.Monitor your bodyTechnology advancement makes it possible for us to monitor our heart rate and patterns using wearable devices. Other useful inputs from these devices are sleep monitoring, blood oxygen, Vo2 Max, Fall detection and so on. It’s a good investment to aware of your body and you can even prevent proactively from underlying conditions by observing these references.Moderate everythingHumans do things and stuffs that gives us a mood boost and a way to intoxicate ourselves for fun. Drinking, Smoking and drugs are probably the top 3 candidates. Some people try to quits. If you do, good for you. If you don’t quit, keep moderate amount of your intake and activities on these habits. By comparison, drinking a glass of wine everyday and binge drinking 2 bottles in 1 night, which one can deplete your health in the long run? I think an answer to this question will help you in understanding how body responds to toxic objects. I know people in person and from reading of other stories, there are people live over 90 years with moderate amount of alcohol consumption. So, keep moderate and reflect on yourself.Meditation or daily reflectionOur mind triggers some bad choices and bad hobbies that leads us to do bad things to ourselves and our health. Imagine an awful day at office and you want to recharge and release your stress at personal time. There are several ways people tend to do such as drinking, socializing, exercising and so on.One important thing most people don’t consider is a minute or 2 or daily reflection by just thinking deeply on the issue, finding your own resolution and writing it down in the journal.You might ask yourself “ummn..how that’s gonna help.” All I can say is give it a try. It works or at least make your mind clear on the matters. We have too many thoughts in our mind from small to world-ending matter. It is fragmented and we need to sort it out in a way to make it easier to breakdown.Final thoughtsIf you read till this point and get something interesting to improve yourself, that’s awesome. However, execute your improvement points and don’t just leave it as an idea though.

At a quick glance, it is similar to MacOS spotlight with tweaks and hands full of customization features. The architecture looks similar to what SublimeText text editor modular ecosystem of packages and add-ons to get fit into your routines and tasks. I’d like to highlight some interesting use cases I found from using this instead of Spotlight for a month and my thoughts on it.Who is it for?From a look at Raycast store which is add-ons that can expand its capability, it shows that the users is targeted for developers and IT professionals. So, it’s a bit over-killed for normal users, however feel free to give it a go. The store is growing more add-ons by time with the contributions from open-source community and it seems to expected more add-ons for end-users, especially in productivity category.Raycast vs Spotlight alternativesRaycast already have manual with solid introduction for new users and I don’t see a point in introduction. The community stories bring ideas and real use cases by different people with different workflows. Again, it is still software devs and IT professionals mostly.There are a lot of similarity in terms of features among Spotlight alternatives such as Alfred. However, Raycast provides fully customization in extensions from key bindings to set up alias and shortcuts. It looks cleaner and UI looks more neat than its competitors.The only point for lazy people like me is that it comes out blank slate for all configurations. I read a blog that a guy replaces it with Rectangle window management tool but I wish I can map these keys by default. Just a lazy guy issue and should not be a negative point for most users.My Raycast ExtensionsRaycast helps in removing some apps that you are using such as clipboard app and window management (after key bindings). The following is a short comment on Raycast exentions I am using. It list down all your “Shortcuts” Apple app automation items andCalculator: It works well and nothing to complain. Spotlight gives a similar result as well.Calendar: I assigned a shortcut and alias for Calendar. It shows event nicely and reminder at Raycast window when it is 15 mins before the event starts. One of my favourite extension I have to say.Timezone: It can convert time zone and can do time differentiation.Currency Exchange: It still needs room to improve as I cannot convert any currency freely like Numi. If you don’t know Numi, check it out and thanks me later.System Preferences: It brings all the preferences to quick access and work nicely. This is one confused result I got from Spotlight. Sometime, it hits the keyword and it is still a hit and miss until latest MacOS Monterey.Reminders: It integrate to Apple reminder out of the box and give you a wizard to create reminder.Floating Notes: I am not a big fan of this feature but it’s for someone who like to jot down thoughts with a shortcut on any screens.Tailscale: I am suprised to find that Raycast has extension for Tailscale VPN solution. It can show list of devices and admin console out of the Raycast extension.Brew: It’s Cakebrew meet Spotlight. You can search brew packages and install new packages or update the outdated binaries.Search Books: I am not recommended to use pirated digital assets but this extension can browse through Library Genesis archives of books and magazines and you can download PDFs rightaway. Be ware of DRM violation based on where you are located though.Google Translate: It can defined 2 languages that you want to translate and it works nicely but limited functions compared with web version that can speak out the translated words and sentences.What I want moreI’d like to have a default set of key bindings for some functions, especially window management with end-user customization. Or a way to import key bindings from a configuration file.Community spaces for sharing snippets and script commands can bring more users and use cases to explore.After installation, a recommended plugins based on software installed on Mac can help users to aware of available extensions to choose. Instead of wondering and browsing the list from A to Z.In summary, this is the best Spotlight alternative I used so far and it is free as of now and the community is growing with unlimited opportunity. I recommend all Mac users to try it out." }, { "title": "How I get into Cyber Security", "url": "/posts/CyberSecurity/", "categories": "Notes, Personal", "tags": "CyberSecurity", "date": "2022-07-25 09:10:00 +0700", "snippet": "This is a story of how I end up as Cyber Security professional and the path that I walked to change my work domain at 26 years old. Things I learned, mistakes I made and more.A bit of metadata on the sections if you want to skip ahead: College 📚: Education and Things I studied in the past Early Career 💼: Paid non-cybersecurity jobs that I started my career with and a trigger Higher Education 🎓: A break from industry for another degree A Jump to the dark side 🥷🏼: A start on Cyber Security job and How I am thriving till nowCollege 📚My country education system was adapted from ancient British Education System. Grade 0 to 10 and take exam that determine what you study. Higher scores at this matriculation exam (A-Levels for UK and Exit Exam for US) gives a chance to choose science subjects such as engineering, medicine and computer science. Lower score give you Art schools and subjects like Physics, Philosophy and Law.You can’t retake exam if you pass but doesn’t reach to the accepted score by college/university. Your life is screwed at that point. I heard of students aiming for medicine school, failed intentionally at the last exam day to retake next year. Medicine is the hardest subject to get entry. I heard the news about reforming this silly rule at 2015 but I don’t know it happens or not.As a typical working class family, my parents want me to be a doctor. I like to fall asleep at Biology class which gives a hint of my interest in it. I put OK effort in this exam and get into Computer school. My parents disappointed for a while and still insist on trying for maritime school. Ships and nautical stuffs pick an interest in me but in reality, I still don’t see myself ruling and navigating a ship in a ocean.I ends up in a Computer Science subject and studied 4 years. Unlike today’s IT school, we barely touch computer during the whole 4 years of my bachelor degree. It’s mostly books and listening to lecturers making you confused about subjects from DBMS, Programming to Operating Systems. The good thing is the learning materials are at a good standard due to replication from a foreign university.I decided to self-learn these tomb sized books out of class to understand the concepts and fundamentals. I owned a PC at my 2nd year to familiar with actual computer, try some practical programming and gaming of course. Friend introduced me to Web 1.0 and internet is shocking at that point. I took A+ course to learn components of computer and hardware, which is the only course I took outside college and learnt a practical understanding of computer.After 4 confused years and get a honored bachelor degree with Computer Science, I kind of stuck in a year or two trying to get into Master degree in a foreign university. I polished my English language skill, meanwhile learning a bit of Computer Programming at a school. These are the downtime of my early adult life.Early Career 💼I ended up working in a local software house and stared some app development with ASP.Net, PHP, and ColdFusion. I barely make any money but developed a skill of logical thinking and understand more of web application development. It’s a combination of aesthetic and logic. However, I found out a bit boring and repetitive after 2 years in the role. The business requirements are similar with a lot of using internal code libraries with slight changes. I also found myself as average developer with average passion on it.As this point in my life, Cyber Security is a blank slate. No interest at all. Until there is an odd-ball incident on the web application I developed for government is sql-injected by some hacktivists. I am like “ what is this sorcery!!”. How come these outsiders can do a damage like that while I am creating a SQL query to remove the js remote call script injected with these so-called hackers. This is the first moment I got some common web exploits and how unsecured websites can pwned by adversary. This is the moment that I initiated my interest and importance of security in Web 2.0 and beyond.A chance has come to me to continue my higher education with a push by my mother to study at Thailand, where I’ve been living for the past 10 years.Higher Education 🎓I applied and a chance to study M.SC (Computer Science) program at a neighbor country. It is a traditional program with a sort of recap of subjects from bachelor degree. Additional learning is R&amp;D and hand-on projects. My past experience in IT industry paid off and makes projects easier to cope.For final thesis project, I have to narrow down to a topic that I am eager to create a new study and doesn’t have a bombarded number of researcher works on it. I spent a month or two on Cyber Security and Digital Forensic research topics and paper. At last, I landed onto a research area that I believe it will give me a learning path and an acceptable research outcome.My thesis advisor suggests me to work on Forensic lab afterwards and I kind of glad that it fell apart. I am pretty sure I am not designed to work in a government facility. I landed a job as security engineer at a service provider company with a lot of questions and excitement.A decision that I made to continue Master degree is one of the biggest dilemma that I made in my life. It is good that I learn to improve my R&amp;D skill and expand my network into a new area. Working at a science lab as a IT admin/developer/research assistant opens my eye in understanding fundamental knowledge of small scaled infrastructure and data analytics. The downside is a gap in your career and kind of fall behind of peers for taking a break at university. In reality, Master degree is not help much for recruiter eyes and it should not be the reason to study it at first. However, I don’t have that much regret after 6 years and it leads me to a decent path in my work and life.A Jump to the dark side 🥷🏼My first job as a security professional comes with a lot of learning and applying to support the team and to fit in the role. A company I joined is a big IT service provider and the company is setting up a new security team to provide services for customers. Senior engineers/consultants have to partake in the business development and also sales process. It’s a learning path of a new domain and business aspect and again, this is my first paid job in a foreign company.Learning about various security technology, market trend and providing consultant, security services gives me a solid foundation to the industry. I worked there for ~3 years before moving on to another opportunity that I am still working at.I joined a security team at telecom company for internal security operations. The idea of joining this in-house position comes from the point to fill in the gap of “understanding more on customer obstacles and pain-points”. By switching from providing services to receiving end, the first adjustment is there is no 1 week,2 weeks projects. This is a short or long term improvement of process and technology to have a good maturity level of all-around security program. To achieve that, there is a need of management approval and funding, right personnel for each roles and security awareness of the organization.The look back on my past working and study experience shows that experience gained from your past domain shows the dominance in your security expertise more or less. In my case, I lean more into application security and endpoint security before making a discussion about network tier. There will be a knowledge gap that we need to fill in to have a holistic understanding of Cyber Security.This is not so long gist of where I am at now. I don’t believe anyone will read this dump of random thoughts but if you do, i am surprised and hope you pick it up something interesting from this.

To sit down and read a book becomes a more or less challenge for people, especially the ones who spend a lot of time on computers and internet.Back to 10–15 years, I can recall the time I have 300–400 collection of books that I read and keep in my home library. I can read books with not much struggle. Just grab a book and enjoy it in home, school and between commute.Everything is different after I started workforce. Spend more of the spare time on a much more relaxing activities from jumping screen to screen. Netflix to PS4. PS4 to Mobile Phone. Flipping through social media and news reader. A vicious cycle of sinking into the dark.These are some of the lifestyle adjustment and ideas that I revived for myself to read more books.SourcesTo read books, we need to find books that we interested to read. I find books from Goodreads recommendations based on my reading profile. Browsing bookstore and local library is also give new interesting books to read. It’s a bit expensive to have physical books but if you have time and money, go for it. I buy books from amazon book store and rend out from Libby with local library account. For audiobooks, I also use Libby app to rent out books to listen during commute and gym sessions.I upgraded my kindle reader OG to PaperWhite version to have backlit at night time. My work place have a library with some limited sources and I use Libby from local library for audiobooks.Reflect on your habits for a changeThe first reflection I have is that I spent too much time listening to music and podcasts. There is not a commitment or a slot on reading. I tend to play games, watch TV or scroll though magazines, blog posts and news. I made a self-commitment or habit change to read more frequently by adding reading as part of daily routine. I start by adapting to listen audiobooks during commute, gym session and chores. I carry around my kindle with me to the pool to read 15–30 minutes before swimming and reading at cafe’ after lunch.1. Toilet bookYes. it’s gross but it’s good to have a book that you can flip a page or two during the nature call.I have a English vocabulary book in my toilet to expand my ESL vocabulary range and a language book to learn new phrases and words. Instead of scrolling your Instagram page, this 2–3 pages reading surprises the progress you made in a short term.2. Two books at the same timeThe first thing I made up my mind is to read and listen one book. I read a soft-copy book or kindle e-book when I have time to sit down and read. Another book is to read on the go at places at gym and commute. It helps in a way that you take a short break from one book for mental reset and switch to another topic. It works for me but might not be the best pick for everyone. A mix of fiction and non-fiction books is the ideal approach for me.3. Selecting book category for audiobooksNot all books are good for for listening. The images and diagrams is used in most book genres to take advantage of visual presentation to explain complex ideas and thoughts. I found the following type of books are good for listening: Non-fictional books with a storied and anecdotes such as Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, the Tipping Points. Fictional story telling books such as Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman. The books read by the authors him/herself. The author can give emotional content that missing in text.4. No Guilt StopThere are people going back to back on the books they are not really enjoying. In my opinion, it is OK to stop reading in the middle of the book if you are certain that you are not interested in the topics, the story and feel like pushing yourself to go forward. Reflect on the reasons and explore another books that pick your interest. Nobody can read all the books in the world. It is important to find what you enjoy reading and find the books that matches your interest.Thanks for reading. It’s a cluster of my reflection on making a habit of reading enjoyable with minimal effort. I hope you find a point or two that can help in your reading journey." }, { "title": "I found the perfect audiobook listening app", "url": "/posts/booklistener/", "categories": "Tech, Apps", "tags": "App, Audiobook", "date": "2022-06-13 10:20:00 +0700", "snippet": "It surprised me when I was looking for a way to listen offline audio files to iOS device.

However, it is limited in terms of choice and time constraint. I tried a bunch of audio/music player but I was disappointed until I found Book Player. As the name suggests, it is designed to listen audio books that included some unique features that can’t find in typical music players. It’s open source project with contributors crafted this beautiful minimal app and it is just perfect.If you are looking for app that designed for audiobooks, I recommend you to try this one.

I starts automation with minimum budget and with no complication. The piece is for people who want to create common automation tasks with 1 or 2 gadgets. It might be a different take for some people but I think it can help you kickstart your home automation project with less doubt.1st - Ecosystem: Google, Amazon vs AppleThe short answer is Amazon Alex, no matter you are using Apple or Android devices. Why? It have the most mature ecosystem and supported by various 3rd party devices, compared with Apple or Google devices. I got Echo dot 4th gen with a very good deal and it is working as I wanted. You can choose Echo Show if you prefer the one with screen to make a call and visual display. You can find out other 3rd party Alex supported devices as well. However, I recommended Echo dot because it seems to be the cheapest for me. So, this will be the heart of your automation command center. Again, please understand that this is based on consideration points with affordability and for better ecosystem.2nd - AccessoriesAfter picking out the automation hub, the 2nd step is to get devices to convert your analog electrical system into smart devices. There are 6 categories of devices that fits in for common home use as the following: Plugs: Smart switches or power strips that you can control via voice commands or from mobile apps Lights: Light bulbs and strips that can change colors and control via your automation hub Sensors: light, smoke, fire, motion sensors for follow-up actions Cameras: indoor/outdoor cameras for security purpose and surveillance of your home Security: smart door locks and alarm systems Entertainment (Audio/ Video): sound bars to entertainment hub including Amazon Echo devices, Smart TVs &amp; SoundbarsAgain, we are working for a tight budget automation system and focus on minimum investment. Before buying anything, you can integrate your existing smart devices to Alexa and perform device discovery. At this point, my vacuum cleaner, bedroom thermometer, air purifier, smart tv are integrated to Amazon Alexa and I can voice command and schedule to automate. I reflect on the gap on additional automation tasks and routines I want to create. In the end, the shopping list goes to 2 smart plugs/switches and small light sensors for kitchen counter and wardrobe.After a research on smart plugs, I found out that Tapo smart plugs is quite affordable and I like that it don’t required a hub to connect to internet. Each plugs can connect directly to your phone app and Alexa compatibility as well. A rechargeable LED light bar from Baseus is also a good find since it have built-in motion sensor and easy to install.I don’t find a need for camera and color light bulb and security system since I resides in a condominium with good physical security.3rd - Automation flowThis is time to list down to create your automation flows. Before that, I want to mention 1 automation app that you might want to use. It’s called IFTTT that you can connect with your Amazon Alexa account and create automation flows with other internet apps. I created some basic flows such as syncing Alexa shopping and to-do list to my Apple Reminder lists. If you run out of ideas, check out some of the automation ideas here.You can also enable Alexa Skills and create routines that works for you. The triggers can be either time, location, voice command or sensor detection. Amazon alexa team also rolling out some voice detection to create notification such as appliance beeping, dog bark and cough and so on. I found some of these routines quite interesting.To sum up, all that I spent for this baseline automation set up costs me roughly around 100 USD with 5 items (Echo dots, 2 Smart plugs and 2 motion sensor light bar. Pretty sweet deal for me. So, think of these tips when you are trying to start a home automation: Check your existing appliances and devices for its compatibility to narrow down the ideal ecosystem for you. List out what you want to achieve and break down into automation tasks Find the gaps and identify devices/gadgets that you need to invest. Keep in mind. Go for reputable brands. Revisit for improvement and use the most out of the devices features.

After that, I end up spending the rest of the evening about how the director perspective of TV manufacturer and other controversial topics around that. This blog post is the by-product of that study and I’ll list down tips of the ideal tuning and tweaks to get the best looking picture for your home cinematic experience.Filmmaker ModeIt is supported by famous directors to get the closest production and intention made by the film directors. It removes features such as motion smoothing and image sharpening that introduced in modern TV after 2019. If you want some movies with filmmaker mode, you will start seeing grains that intentionally created by directors and it looks darker. However, color looks saturate and odd in some movie category like anime and cartoons. A youtube clip by STOP THE FOMO points out some interesting points about filmmaker mode and its downsides.If your TV have this, experiment it to find out there is any improvement or not.My cheap Samsung 4K TV doesn’t have it and can’t try to share my personal experience on this.Modes for different watching experienceThe first point to consider before deciding how many settings to configure is the lighting in the room. For people who watch TV at bright room, it is important to set higher number of backlight and brightness to counteract room light. For dark room with minimal light, average backlight and brightness still gives an ideal viewing experience.I set up 2 modes for watching movie and a natural one with slight brighter setting for daytime viewing. Set up scenes at Alexa to toggle the mode easily by saying keywords.Settings to focus for picture qualityCNET have a through post of the tips on all settings and criteria to consider while setting it up. I’ll extract the most important settings by order to get the best looking picture for modern TV.Base ModesSelect to Movie mode before tuning other settings. Movie mode offers ideal movie watching setup with good color and neutral color temp. However, that depends on TV manufacturer.If you want a 2nd mode, use Standard mode and set brightness and backlight to higher for daytime watching experience if the room exposes to sunlight or artificial light.Color temperatureWarm color gives natural looking picture of objects than cool color temp which makes everything bluish and pale.SharpnessSet to 0 because it only sharpens artificially which is not intended by film makers and it will remove grains from objects such as human faces and introduces noise.BacklightDepends on the room light, set suitable value that can balance white and black color. If the value is too high, white background will beam your eyes. If the setting is too low, you can’t see dark color on the screen clearly.Contrast and BrightnessAdjust these 2 settings side by side with trial and error. The reason behind this is contrast controls how white the white colors looks and brightness controls how black the black color looks. Too much of these 2 settings will deviate the accuracy of the pictures and it displays whiter and darker than it supposes to. Use a movie or a video clip that you see with your eyes before such as sports event or places you’ve been to to calibrate these settings.ColorJust leave it as default settings. I play around these settings and don’t see any good outcome.Motion SmoothingThis can be called Motion Interpolation or Auto Motion Plus is introduced after picture quality is high to 4K resolution. It becomes a big controversial topic among film makers and film watchers. Many film makers who supposes FilmMaker mode hates this Soap Opera Effect and there are enthusiasts that finds that it have benefits to motion blur and judder in the movie for Hi-Res TV.I am not saying that it needs to turn it off but at least lower the setting to eliminate false smoothing out the fast moving scenes that it is not intended by movie makers. If you totally hate it, just disable it completely.This is all the important settings that you need to check on your expensive TV if you haven’t done yet. You will see an improvement in overall picture quality and movie watching experience." }, { "title": "How to have a tidy living space with zero effort for dudes", "url": "/posts/clean/", "categories": "Notes, LifeStyle", "tags": "Life hack, Productivity", "date": "2022-05-16 10:45:00 +0700", "snippet": "I am a single guy living alone for more than 15 years since I was studying bachelor degree. It is life changing to take care of your home by yourself. Along these 15 years, I picked it up a habit to tidy up your living place and life with putting very minimum effort. I hope you find something useful from this piece. If you are living with a family or sharing space with other, some of these tips might not work.Chain your chores with routine ⏱️Imagine cleaning room, laundry and other chores on every weekends that you suppose to rest is painful. Nobody wants to do that and people relies on house maid or cleaning service which costs money and you have to bring in strangers to your house. Instead of doing that, get up from sofa and move around a bit while listening to a podcast, audiobook or music and do some chores.The main idea is to come up with an idea of how to chain your chore with daily routine. You are relaxing after work and the idea of get up to clean toilet is just painful. I normally add a single chore before your routine such as cleaning toilet before shower, taking out trash while walking out for lunch, schedule washing machine to the Saturday morning and enjoy hanging clothes with a sip of a cup of joe. By arranging like that, your weekends is plain blank chore-free for you to enjoy hobbies and activities.A dedicated place for everything 📑Make a habit of assigning spots for everything you own. Utensils and plates in sink. Socks in wash bin. Clean folded clothes in wardrobe. Keys in your key holder spots. After a week or two, you will build up a muscle and unconscious memory to organize your home without any thoughts all. Try it and you can skip a chore of daily/weekly de-cluttering task in no time.Don’t hoard things 📰I ran into room filled with tower of old newspaper, pamphlets, and unknown items. Wardrobe fills up with t-shirts from 20 years ago, just pilling in there. Too many things in your living space makes it hard to tidy up. Don’t need to Marie Kondo. Just give out and recycle time by time. sell back 2nd hand items you don’t use anymore online. It’ll help to minimize the stuffs you need to clean.Invest on vacuum cleaner 🧹It’s a bit expensive house appliance but it’s worth the money spent. Imagine it like a mini maid that take care of your floor without your supervision in a daily basis forever (till it breaks down). I own a rumba costs more than 4k TV and there is no regret.Don’t wash a single dish 🍽️There are people who have a urge to clean a single plate or a dirty cup. DON’T’. Washing dishes drain our mental energy every time you do it. I limit myself to not more than 1 time per day. Soak into water and a bit of pre-wash and pile them up to wash up later.Don’t make up your bed everyday 🛏️It’s your home and not a hotel room. It don’t need to have a neat folding blanket everyday. In my opinion, spreading it out the blanket is better than folding it. It can get a natural sunlight and airflow can avoid of trapping tiny dust mites and bacteria.Do your laundry in group 🧺Putting every piece of cloth together for a single laundry is just not effective. I tend to keep separate bins for gym clothes and other. At least these 2 categories need to laundry separately to have different treatment. Another step is to do tops and bottoms separately (if you have enough pairs to continue).Don’t buy air fresheners. It’s TOXIC 🧪I don’t see the point of air fresheners for temporary refreshing room. It contains toxic chemicals and you are just wasting money. I suggests to have air purifier that help your room get rid of pollution and pollens. Use dehumidifier for toilet and natural air ventilation is the best way in general.If there are other tips or any feedbacks on these above life hacks, DM me at twitter 🐦." }, { "title": "LAPSUS$ Tactics Breakdown", "url": "/posts/lapus/", "categories": "Security, Threat", "tags": "Threat Actor, Analysis", "date": "2022-05-06 13:53:00 +0700", "snippet": "The LAPSUS$ threat actor group changes the way cybersecurity professional views the threat landscape. If you are working in Threat Intel area or tracking threat actor groups, it is quite technical with the construct of new methods to penetrate systems and exploit development. The tactics and techniques used by LAPSUS$ group is fairly straightforward and simple to manipulate human factor of the cybersecurity. This piece is to explore some of the techniques used by threat actor to exploit major IT companies.LAPSUS$ Profile SummaryLAPSUS$ is first seen in underground at July 2021 and the use of telegram channel to name and shame victims and interaction with 3rd parties. The group targets to various vertical sectors across the globe, range from Microsoft to Electronic Arts Inc. The highlight of LAPSUS$ group is the compromise to Okta Inc. via unauthorized access of Okta employee credential to the company network.Use of Stolen Credentials for Initial AccessThe first victim of LAPSUS$ is Brazilian Ministry of Health and Claro, a Latin American telecommunications company from use of credential purchase from underground market. On Nvidia case, it seems to show the use of compromised accounts on cloud service providers to gain access.It is fairly straightforward way to achieve it since the hard job is done by the credential seller which stolen from info stealer malware implant or from organization insider threats. Another way of the group access is from compromised credentials of employee personal account and deploy info-stealer to harvest work related credentials.Insider ThreatOn March 10, 2022, the threat group announced that they are recruiting insiders working for international telecommunications and software companies, hosting providers and call centers. It gives a hint of past success access comes from insiders selling the legitimate credentials of VPN or other remote desktop accounts to the cyber-criminal for financial gain.A Cocktail of Old School Social EngineeringMicrosoft called LAPSUS$ as ‘DEV-0537’ reported on the group tactics of social engineering and extortion campaign as destructive elements as the following: DEV-0537 is known for using a pure extortion and destruction model without deploying ransomware payloads….DEV-0537 doesn’t seem to cover its tracks. They go as far as announcing their attacks on social media or advertising their intent to buy credentials from employees of target organizations….Their tactics include phone-based social engineering; SIM-swapping to facilitate account takeover; accessing personal email accounts of employees at target organizations; paying employees, suppliers, or business partners of target organizations for access to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) approval; and intruding in the ongoing crisis-communication calls of their targets.Among these tactics, I was a bit surprised to see SIM-swapping is still a working approach to get 2FA token and SMS messages.Lesson Learnt for Enterprise SecurityMicrosoft report contains a great recommendation list to follow for remediation and mitigation. I’d like to highlight some important factors to prevent credential related attacks and social engineering. Make sure to have a through detection use cases to detect abuse of credentials and MFA. MFA authentication needs to implement properly and monitor for any changes. Invest on User behavior analytics (UBA) solution and monitor login attempts from unusual geolocation. Separate communication channel or out-of-band channel for incident response. Revise password rotation policy and account lockout policy for both privileged and non-privileged accounts. Encourage employee to report insider threats and awareness of the issue. Security awareness program for employees, especially on password security. If there is a capability, implement a program to monitor credential leak on darkweb and social media." }, { "title": "I found the perfect comic reading app for IPad Mini", "url": "/posts/comic/", "categories": "Tech, Apps", "tags": "Comic, Apple, Book", "date": "2022-05-04 16:22:00 +0700", "snippet": "If you are the owner of 8” iPad Mini or smaller devices and a comic or graphic novel fan, you might explore free or paid comic apps.

It leads to a reflection of my daily workflow in managing personal and work life. I found out that there are too many apps and not clear objectives of how I was using these apps. I think of a way to make things easier to manage instead of using a dozen apps and painful data flow.So, I decided to breakdown the minimal number of apps for my workflow and cut down some apps that I don’t need to use it. Please bare in mind that my work PC is Windows and my personal devices are Apple (iPhone+MacOS+iPad mini). You can choose the best that suit your requirements. Alternative choices for Apple apps can be Google apps (Google Keep, Google Tasks).Free or Paid apps?Don’t buy apps or subscribe services until you REALLY think you need the features the paid apps offering to you.The apps I am gonna share is either default apps or commercial ones provided by my work. It totally fulfill what I needed and some free apps are surprising feature rich that we don’t know yet.At one point, you find out that there are feature(s) that absoluletly require to fill in the workflow gap and it is time to consider purchasing paid apps.Work/ Life Separation or Integration?The first thing I did to find out what I needed is breakdown apps into 2 groups (Work and Life). If you want to keep everything in a single app, that is alright but for data privacy and security reasons, I rather keep them separated.You can use one app for both purpose and I was using Microsoft OneNote for all the notes and stuffs for years. However, if your work data privacy and security doesn’t allow it, you have to think of a different app or multiple accounts within one app. Toggling multiple accounts in a single app is not convenient IMO.📆 Calendar as Mission ControlAfter that, Think of calendar as your mission control cockpit for organizing and feed all data points to it. Fanstastical (Free) is the best option for me because it can integrate with Apple Reminder and all other calendars that I used (Microsoft O365 and Apple Calendar). Afterward, you can create a widget at the devices for daily and weekly recap.Making appointment and meeting is ok for calendar, however bloating calendar with all tasks and planning is messy. I use Apple Reminder app for sub -tasks and details which ported into calendar for overview.🧠 Reminder as your backup brainOne simple idea that GRIP author explains of people behaviors of keeping to-do tasks in unconsicous mind. Everybody does it and it is hard and waste of energy. We keep forgetting tasks and plans are not solid. Productivity becomes sluggish because you keep reminding yourself for that phone call you have to make 5 hours later.I use Apple Reminder for all sort of tracking ranged from simple tasks, repetitive reminder, shopping list and trip planning.This is my tips on using reminders: Make folders for category like projects, personal taks, team member names for discussion/to-do and so on. If you use Apple reminders, make use of smart folders with tags Make notifications by time, location or messaging as relevant Add priority to NEVER miss critical tasks Link with Alexa or smart devices to add tasks without typing it down (This is how I keep my shopping and some chores) Use of Share button to create a reminder from browser or Finder directly. Integrate with your calendar if possible to view your tasks with schedule. Fanstastical calendar app does awesome job on this.🗒️ Systematic Note takingYou might think there is nothing to think about when taking notes. Right? Well, There is ton of youtube clips on exploring the best note-taking approach. I used One Note for all work related notes in several notebooks for ~10 years and so far, nothing to complain about. It works cross platform and you can use apple pencil to jot down and draw diagram quickly.For personal note taking, I uses Apple Notes for short form of writing and convert it into Reminder as necessary. Notion is my go-to app for complicated note tracking from bullet journal to kanban board. I wrote this blog with Notion and export it out as markdown format to the post. It is free for personal use and I recommend you to try it out if you haven’t.🎨 Visual Note TakingThere are many diagramming and mind mapping apps. I select Flowdia because i like to draw diagrams on iPad with Apple Pencil and it just works perfectly. Mind Note for quick mind map diagrams that you can view it from iPhone, Macbook and iPad over iCloud sync.⚒️ Other productivity tools?You can jump over to my dynamic list to check some other tools that I enjoyed over the year.So If you want to reflect on your work flow and productitvity kit, the following steps to come up with a clear mind map on: List down all the apps Create a diagram to show the linkage of these apps to view what you REALLY needs and the rest of apps installed and never used Make a purpose of each apps and define it how you planning to use it Make a data flow and integration among them and other automation tools (Shortcuts, IFTTT, smart devices) for ease of use and convenience Revise and adjust as necessary with pilot testAt the end, you will have a crystal clear approach on tracking, making tasks and schedules without a pause with thoughts like “ohh..where to jot it down?, where did i take that note on?, forget my kids at school and so many life problems”.Have fun and if you enjoy reading this or chat on it, DM me at twitter🐦." }, { "title": "Apple Universal control is the future", "url": "/posts/UC/", "categories": "Tech, MacOS", "tags": "Apple, MacOS", "date": "2022-04-22 13:25:00 +0700", "snippet": "What is Apple Universal Control ?When Apple announced Universal Control, I thought it is too good to be true. A single peripheral device control multiple machines without any setup? That’s something peripheral devices manufactures like Logitech are offering with keyboard that can toggle among input devices but not as smoothly as Universal Control can deliver. It’s a pretty sleek feature that can boost your productivity as an add-on functionality that is missing in Sidecar.Here is 3 reasons why it is ideal solution than 3rd party technology like Logitech Flow:No Additional CostIt works out of the box if you own compatible Apple products and initial 1 minute set up.It don’t need to be apple keyboard and mouse. It can be any peripheral devices you are using since the connection is done by MacOS and iPadOS.Flexibility and customizationIt can work with a Macbook. Mac mini or iMac with multiple iPads and you can arrange the displays as the way you work in a regular day. This setup from DailyTeek Youtube channel is pretty interesting with a thoughtful setup to fulfill his daily work flow with full utlization of iPad touch screen, apple pencil and multiple displays that he have.No additional software/driversI tried Logtitech mouse with its Flow technology that I want to copy/paste text and transfer files between my Macbook and Window device but it didn’t work due to security restrictions of both operating system (keep in mind that Window device is cooperate hardened machine). The additional software and drivers is quite buggy and it consumes resources quite heavily. I ended up uninstalling them and it becomes a regular mouse.Why is it the future?I believe this can be a standard productivity flow for most people and other companies such as Microsoft will adapt this one way or another to fulfill Windows operating system with 3rd party computer manufacturers and display company. I wish Apple will also pattern this with display company to support this functionality like what they did AirPlay with Samsung smart TVs.Instead of connecting MacBook with USB-C dock to a monitor or TV to use as a separate display, either Sidecar and/or Universal Control support can make us get rid of these annoying adaptors.This can’t happen very soon but I think there is a possibility on it. Regrading recent patent registration by Apple, it seems they are trying to improve Universal Control capability pivoting around Apple ecosystem with extending more productivity workflow and bring in iPhone.So, if you are Apple Mac and iPad users and have not tried this feature yet, you are really missing out and give it a go.

It leads to security issues such as DNS Cache Poisoning and typo-squatting domains.DNS Over HTTPs (DoH) brings TLS/SSL encapsulation on HTTP traffic to boost security integrity issues of spoofing and tampering of DNS requests from clients to providers. In this article, i will refer DNS Over HTTPs as DoH abbreviation.The GoodThis brings better security for personal home network to prevent DNS based attacks and sniffing by attackers. You can find many DoH supported upstream providers and browser like Firefox already added this functionality in 2019 and started rolling out. There are project that showing the possibility to set up DoH server and set up pi-hole to relay DoH instead of standard DNS.In general, this sounds like a good idea for individual users since it improves security of the DNS requests, however security professionals are pointing out caveats and challenges in enterprise network. Existing DNS security solution like DNS Sinkhole (which already have other issues) needs a redesign to support both DoH traffic and standard DNS traffic as fallback DNS request.The BadEnterprise network relies network security control and monitoring using standard DNS traffic and containment of malicious domains via DNS security solutions and sink-holing.There is SEI post from Carnegie Mellon University talks on 3 aspects to fight back risks bring from DoH. I want to comment on the points that we need to consider during executing these strategies:Strategy 1: Disable DoH in Managed Endpoints. It is a plausible control to restrict configuration of DoH on applications to to whitelist applications if this aligns with organization security policies.Strategy 2: Block Known DoH Providers for Managed and Unmanaged Endpoints. This is a bit of whack-a-mole approach to block DoH upstream DNS provides. As of 2022, even Google have DoH endpoints and if the enterprise solution starts using DoH on its products, admin going to need to whitelist these providers and this make things messier.The UglyStrategy 3: Assume Breach and Focus on Detection. A secure way to establish DNS traffic brings unwanted audience whom are adversaries that are constantly seeking a better way to perform anomalous activities. To be able to detect DoH traffic among other HTTP, it needs a rethink of SIEM log collection and detection engineering as the start: Security Operation needs to think of log collection to distinguish DoH traffic to merge in standard DNS traffic data model. RFC-8484 also describes the protocol description and implementation details. There is already academic paper in researching a initial analysis on DoH traffic identification. The following code snippets is HTTPS GET/POST requests and example response from DoH server. It shows what “application/dns-message” is the keyword to identify DoH Traffic. # HTTP GET Request Sample of DoH traffic :method = GET :scheme = https :authority = dnsserver.example.net :path = /**dns-query**?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB **accept = application/dns-message** # HTTP POST Request Sample of DoH traffic :method = POST :scheme = https :authority = dnsserver.example.net :path = /dns-query accept = application/dns-message **content-type = application/dns-message** content-length = 33 &lt;33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding&gt; 00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01 # HTTP Response Request Sample of DoH traffic :status = 200 **content-type = application/dns-message** content-length = 61 cache-control = max-age=3709 &lt;61 bytes represented by the following hex encoding&gt; 00 00 81 80 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 1c 00 01 00 00 0e 7d 00 10 20 01 0d b8 ab cd 00 12 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04 Think of a way to include DoH traffic in TLS interception to have visibility of DoH traffic. Detection engineer and Threat intel analyst requires to sit down together how to include existing detection use cases and upcoming scenarios to include DoH traffic. Monitor new TTPs and approaches used by adversary to have a detection strategy to prevent potential attacks to the organization. There are concerns and discussion in cybersecurity community on how to handle the risks of DoH with security controls. The protocol itself is in the early stage and there is still time for preparing to monitor and detect DoH traffic used by adversary. I’ll write up on a specific procedural mitigation actions that security professionals can exercise.

This is the first entry after I redesigned and deployed this new site. Throughout the decision making process on the choice of platform and tools, I got some ideas and update to share with you, my friends..Platforms for blogging or NewslettersThere are criteria that helps to narrow down the options: Free or Paid Options 💰 Self-hosted website, social media or community platforms? 🏠 Type of content? (blogs, art/design or professional articles) 🧑🏼‍🎨 Support of newsletter integration and comment 📰 Technical capability of you or your team (custom domain setup, Hosting setup, CMS knowledge, VCS, CI/CD flow, General Web Development skills) 🥷🏻OptionsThese questions will give a guideline on the path that you can decide for your blog or portfolio website. The following mind map shows a glance of the options that you can pick from.It’s a lot of options but after browsing through some of these services, you will have an initial idea of the blogging platform that can fit your requirement.As for non-technical friends that want to kick start a blog, a site like Medium or Ghost is a good start for general bloggers and SubStack for professional writers.I included “By Technology” for developers and technical guys who want to study or build a website based on a particular JS framework such as Hexo and Jekyll.Another interesting choice for Notion.so user is blog based on Notion with no-brainer setup.Why I select GitHub Pages for bloggingIf you knows a bit of web development and CI/CD flow, there are options that you can craft website with template and customize before hosting to the hosting services ranged from Github to AWS. This is a decision making flow for mine: I was not looking for community blogs like Medium as primary site. I don’t want to pay for subscription for using platform except custom domain set up. I want to maintain all my blog posts in markdown format locally as backup and also want to customize theme and custom domain. Jekyll is my choice of tech stack with markdown editor support I mostly blog text with few images. I just want to use GitHub to maintain source code and content.I was using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for ~5 years and it is a good option for tech savvy want to try small website. It is relatively easy to start with user.github.io domain that you can set up custom domain. Remember, It’s ONLY for a static page website and NOT ideal for web applications. I do have Medium account that I posted some of the blogs from my main site as a way to promote using its strong community users.Other considerations It is always ideal to choose the platform or approach that you can backup or export out your blogs for migration to another platform. To avoid platform lock-in. Markdown is a must-know markup language for bloggers because many of the platform relies on it. OR use Notion.so for markdown writing and export it out. Git version control system if you maintain blog site by yourself. Boosting SEO and audience is always a challenge if you set up a self-hosted site or from scratch. Communication channel and newsletter integration is not available in free platforms and it needs 3rd party integrations or paid tier in the platforms. Custom domain needs to purchase by yourself from namecheap.com or godaddy.com and most freemium sites required a paid tier to set it up.I hope I help you jumpstart your blogging journey and if there is any questions upon the points I take or mistakes, DM me at twitter🐦." }, { "title": "2022 Outlook", "url": "/posts/2022/", "categories": "Notes, Personal", "tags": "Memo", "date": "2021-12-28 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "A look back into 2021, it’s not the year that I achieve something to proud of.

Sometimes, people are blinded for one’s personal agenda. This is understanable until it affects to ten of thousands of peope. As the other days, I saw a post on social media of the comparison between how many people are dead from Covid-19 and junta massacre is like 500 fold of the virus. I used to think that black sheep are a lonesome outcast and in this case, the hatred of a group of people with a blinded leader becomes a back sheep flock.I came from a political parent who suffers from the past coup and how brutal the military tatics on this matter based on his life-long story. However, this time, things are not gonna turn out like the same outcome with the commitment and mindset of the public. You can jail a person but his or her mind. You can kill a person but not his or her belief. This is not a political warfare for Burmese citizens, it’s a nation state warefare and freedom violated.In a time like this, it is important to focus on the mind, more than the situation.

A bit of morale dellima in taking this exam but I have to say the learning experience and knowlege gain is worth the pain. This is a bit of extension on what I jot down at reddit post.Since I am already in ISC2 circle with SSCP, this is economical since the annual fee is fixed for no matter how many ISC2 credentials you hold. A good alternative can be CISM from ISACA with another 150 bucks more.CISSP MindsetI’ll write it down in a cluster non-structured form with points of some mindset and preapation after passing the exam: There is no definite bullet-proof preparation for this exam. You might ask how to approach this exam with high success rate. 3 big criteria is Actual experience, critical thinking as risk advisory &amp; reading recommended books to pick up your weak domains to research and to understand more on some concepts. Reddit Entry on preparion and resources.It’s quite a head scratcher and some questions are repeating with different approach to validate your understanding of the topic.Exam cram is quite important to catch up domains or topics you like to forget. I did a lot of logical grouping of technical/ non-technical concepts to make it easy to rule out the noise in multiple choice. There is several questions that I didn’t understand or know at all but smart guess and exam strategy does the job.Resources:1.CISSP Offical Study Guide 8th Edition: The main source of information that I relied on because it is easier to absorb than CBK. ONLY rely process such as risk management process, change management from this book. Other books will make you confused. Read this book like 4 times in different aspects to grasp most of the concepts and theories. Take notes of stuffs you don’t understand and research online until you get it clearly and note it down what you research to read it when it is like one or two weeks before exam.2.CISSP in 10 Hours: Read it like a magazine to find out anything missing form book #1.3.CISSP 21 days: Conceptual digram from this book is quite good to understand big picture of each domains.

In daily security operations, we are using these terms interchangeably, however it is better to understand the accurate meanings.IOAs can describe the active attack series by adversary that is occurring in real time which is via real time monitoring and detection.The security sensors and security analysts can detect and escalate IOAs such as malicious IPs probing network, repetitive malware infection on a particular host, established inbound/outbound connections to IP from a country that the organization don’t deal business.IOCs shows the evidence and artifacts left by attackers such as running malware process, dropped malware in system, and logs that show adversary lateral movement. These indicators can use to clean up and identify the compromised hosts in the organization and to create custom signatures for detection.In this piece, it describes the importance of IOCs in Incidence Response, especially in Investigation process and creation &amp; deployment of IOCs. By comparing with IOAs &amp; IOCs, most security folks are more familiar with IOCs due to the community effort to share, maintain and contribute the artifacts from the incidents.IOCs FundamentalsIOC lifecycle composes of the creation of IOCs from incidents, sharing the IOCs via Threat intel platform and correlation and enrichment of IOCs and archiving and categorization. To share different type of IOCs , security practitioners come up with standardized protocols such as OpenIOC,Yara, CyboX, STIXX and STAXX. It is out of scope to compare and discuss the pros and cons of these standard and I will leave that for further research. Another must-know protocol is called TLP (Traffic Light Protocol) which uses 4 color grades to describe sharing boundaries of the information.Many commercial and open source platforms are available that security practitioners can contribute and look for IOCs and the attack trends. Go to AlienVault OTX, ThreatConnect, Talos Intelligence, VirusTotal to get an idea of the platforms and type of IOCs available among them. For e.g., AlienVault OTX curates list of IPs, malware hashes, domains, emails of a particular malware based on third-party resources such as blogs, news and threat research article. VirusTotal is not IOCs platform, which is more of a lookup database to check the URL,IPs or hashes is malicious or not by the examiners (AV Engines) .IOCs Use CaseIn general, IOCs can help in preventing attacks before it happens proactively and to use it during incident response.The entry level use case for IOC is matching and correlation with logs that maintain in SIEM system via Threat Intel application. It can reveal and discover the inbound IPs that inside your network or the C2 callback server from your internal network that can’t identify by the existing security monitoring tools.Another typical source type that is important to correlate is with DNS logs. The reason behind that is because some RAT and APT traffic don’t support DNS log and there is no app log or else.Having IOCs and other sources that can flag malicious traffic and malware is not having threat intel. Threat Intel platform or provider analyzes and forwards a very specific threat indicators that relate to your organization’s region, sector and known target threat adversary that CISO and management needs to focus on.Types of IOCsThere is a term called Pyramid of Pain by FireEye Mandiant that presents the pain points and how difficult to maintain the Threat Intel data.The listing of IOCs type is also in the order of least painful and easy to use threat intel data to the most difficult ones. The attached pdf also contains more detail information with example of each. Hashes: SHA1,MD5 hashes of malware executables, PE files and malicious attachments that you can look up or create ones that you collect. Most folks call this as creating custom malware signatures. IPs: Known malicious C2 IPs, low reputation IPs. Domains: Domain names of a bunch of domain name with sub-domains used by attackers Network/Host Artifacts: Anything that left as evidence by attackers in network traffic level and host level. Normally, sandbox and simulating the malware artifacts can reproduce the changes in file system and registry keys and in memory level. Tools: Like us, adversary implements software to do the bad things. Mitre ATTCK has a list of known software users by adversay. TTPs : It stands for Tactis, Techniques and Procedures used by attackers. Basically, it provides the entire operation of adversary. A successful TTPs threat intel can provide the entire cyber attack kill chains of threat campaigns. Ref: https://rvasec.com/slides/2014/Bianco_Pyramid%20of%20Pain.pdfOutroThe bottom line is IOCs is a good starting point but it is not the end of Threat Intel program. Leverage and use the IOCs and threat intel to your security operation to improve KPIs and pinpointing the attacks before it’s too late." }, { "title": "Penetration Testing - Business Logic Test", "url": "/posts/Web-Application-Penetration-Testing/", "categories": "Security, Application Testing", "tags": "Security, Development", "date": "2019-03-30 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "A state of MindUnlike other penetration testing techniques, business logic testing gives a headache to most beginner testers. This is an a testing area that the testers with application mind can find a way in better than professionals comes from network &amp; system background. This post is not a “know-how” techniques of how to exploit the web application. This is more of ideas that what the developers might do wrong in their application design, forgotten security requirements and implementation issues.Mythical MitMMitM attacks or attempts is something developers think it is not gonna occurs. Nobody will try to intercept this communicational channels. The communication channel is secure and it’s good enough. All of these assumptions are not correct.Even though the name applies “middle”, it is more of the attackers pretends to be either sender or receiver and the attack surface is not in the “middle”. So, it is important to understand all sensitive information and API calls need to be comprehended by the attackers using simple proxy tool by setting up as ad-hoc connection.I discovered several vulnerabilities that causes by abusing the application functions due to limited security measures set to back-end API calls.Encryption is only for passwordsEncryption/ decryption is to ensure the message is confidential during the data-in-transit and data-at-rest. It supposes to exercise on all sort of “secrets”, not only for passwords. The examples of secrets can be credit card information, user identity, credit card data, and any sensitive information. For e.g., the payment function transfer money from user 1 to user 2, it is important to encrypt the user id that attackers can’t decode easily.Payment gateway is secure MythPayment gateway API process the payment made by your application end user but it is important to make sure that the credit card information, the payee and payer information need to be encoded to increase the obfuscation that the attacker can’t digest easily. Just by hijacking the session and modifying the payee information can make a lot of issues to your application payment and its business.There is no Cookie MonsterHTTP cookie lets you keep information in your end-user device. The general idea is to ensure PII and credentials are not exposed and all information needs to encrypt. If your application uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transmit, do implement your cookie information to secure as well via secure flag and HttpOnly. Otherwise, the monster will find a way to eat your cookies. If the attackers can bypass your authentication scheme, the business impact is critical.Attackers don’t forget passwordsThere is no such standard to implement “Forget Password” function. However, it is required to design a balance between user experience and security. If it’s too easy to request passwords by just knowing the email address of user name, the attackers likely to mess around by bully requesting passwords of a victim. By combining end-user personal information plus public information or out-of-bound authentication makes things a lot safer and the attacker is not likely to guess your first girlfriend name. :DSum upAs for the penetration testers without development background, it sounds like a guess work. The way to think is to identify business logic issues is to predict the “security debt” and functional flaws made by the programmers.I hope this write-up helps.

The reason behind this is that DevOps is an underlying building block of DevSecOps which brings the attribute of speed, precision and automation. The core principles of DevOps is to deliver software faster and more reliable by designing automated integration and delivery pipeline with collaboration of Development and Operation team. Even with reliable process and technology, people plays a critical part to adopt DevOps mindset and culture.The need for Security in the DevOps pipeline itself and the developing software brings security aspect of software development and the term DevSecOps is born. The nature of Security is allergic reaction to Dev team and Ops team which makes it a big burden to interoperable in SDLC process.DevSecOps = Secure DevOps?The Short answer is Yes.The idea of Developer centric approach is essential to implement DevSecOps program by adopting security tools/process focus on developers, not the conventional security testing process. Choose the tools that developers can work within their development environment. Choose the process that operation team can integrate with CI/CD chain and enjoy automating security testing.When we say Left-Shift testing approach, we are implying 2 objectives; testing as early as possible and mitigating vulnerabilities continuously throughout Development. By testing as early development stage, stubborn vulnerabilities are mitigated and the effort is less than fixing during testing phase or deployment phase. There might be some people thinking how about we fix it all at 1 point. 100% secure software is impossible and it is important to brings justification on security risk assessment and prioritization. Continuous Security Monitoring is required to compensate residual risks and zero vulnerabilities.Who is Security Champion?A new DevSecOps team in your organization needs a hero called Security Champion. He/She is top-notch developer with security in mind. He/She has a strong desire and mission to “secure all applications” motto. Security champion can talk developers language and also can communicate with security brokers and he/she knows when to raise the issues. This role also involves promoting the security awareness and secure coding practices to all developers.In my opinion, this is one important model that management should prioritize when forming a DevSecOps team. At the end of the day, DevSecOps culture is the main drive that will keep the entire DevSecOps process effectively.Everyone is security engineerSecurity team controls the security posture of the applications is not working anymore. Everyone needs to become aware of their security responsibilities. To order to fulfill the skills gap and security knowledge, the security professional should introduce development team about secure software development, vulnerabilities that lies in open source components, understanding of the security issues &amp; remediation guideline, security testing solutions in DevSecOps. On the other hand, security professionals should learn new skills to collaborate with development team, fundamental knowledge of software development, consulting and understanding of the issues from developer perspective.What about AppSec Pipeline?OWASP AppSec Pipeline adopts the principles of DevOps into application security program. There is some articles that mentions DevSecOps is the next generation of AppSec Pipeline. In my opinion, I believe AppSec pipeline is still a suitable program for organizations that want to decrease complexity of DevOps pipeline and segregation of duty between Development/Operation and Security.OutroThis is a just a fragment of thoughts on DevSecOps on some common questions that I am having. Continuous learning is a key for developing skills and knowledge that everyone in the DevSecOps team can practice to build a world class software development program. OWASP DevSecOps Studio is a good starting point for people who wants to dive in to learn DevSecOps concepts right away." }, { "title": "ISC2 SSCP Exam Tips", "url": "/posts/SSCP/", "categories": "Security, Certification", "tags": "Guide, Exam", "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "I passed SSCP certification exam from ISC2 recently. The post is to share preparation tips and reasons to take this exam. There is not a lot of posts on Internet about SSCP prep since it’s not quite a popular exam and I hope this article helps people who decided to take SSCP.Why SSCPThe first thing is to understand SSCP exams and its nature. IMO, it’s entry-mid level exam with focusing to examine technical/administrative thinking for security practitioners. It’s also a very good starter exam for those who can’t obtain CISSP due to lack of working experience or knowledge. I decided to take SSCP instead of CISSP due to shortage of 5 years working experience. Moreover, I believe this exam covers a good learning path and can transfer knowledge for CISSP exam in the future. Moreover, you can waive 1 year working experience to pursue CISSP after obtaining SSCP. Apart from SSCP, there are several alternative good exams from SANS,CompTIA and so on. Still, CISSP from ISC2 is the de-facto standard in terms of knowledge coverage and job opportunity and it becomes a clear choice for most cybersecurity professionals.PreparationThere are so many approaches people prepare for ISC2 exams and it depends on you as well. you can start by selecting self-study, taking class and online-learning. I decided to read 2 books and take notes and mind map for the recap. The first primary book is ISC2 SSCP Official Study Guide from Sybex. It’s important Not to skip this book because it is designed to cover all 7 domains and topics and technical terms used in the book are the same with the questions from exam. Make sure to find the latest edition at the time of taking exam. The second book is SCP Systems Security Certified Practitioner All-in-One Exam Guide, Second Edition. I uses the all-in-one book as reference and didn’t read back to back. it’s good to read for a particular topic that you are not quite good at it and want to improve your understanding. I didn’t take any practice tests but it is recommended by most people who take ISC2 exam. There are people who suggests about things like brain dumps and stuffs. I don’t recommend it because I believe we should embrace the learning process and earn the certification.SSCP Exam NatureThe exam questions are not long and you have plenty of time of think, write it down to get to the MOST correct answer. Some questions can have more than 1 correct answer and your job is to simulate the question as a real scenario to pick the ideal ones. The exam requires critical thinking to get the correct answer and make sure to review the questions you have doubt. No need to rush.There are 125 questions for 3 hours and you have 1.5 mins per question to answer, which is plenty of time. Concentrate and put all the things you read from your brain and make a logical decisioning.Endorsement ProcessAfter you passed CAT exam, the next step is to go through endorsement process and follow the instructions that send to your email by ISC2. Online endorsement from ISC2 makes the process quite convenient and ease to process.Additional Reference:Official SSCP Exam Page" }, { "title": "Pebble EOL and alternatives", "url": "/posts/pebble_die/", "categories": "Tech, Gadget", "tags": "Smart Watch, Wearables", "date": "2017-03-27 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "I am writing this after a year using Pebble Time.

The landscape of the attackers is expanding to more scary things like ransomware attacks and I think it is important for everyone to understand what is ransomware. ESET Ransomware Explained(vid) is also a short nice video of what ransomware capable of. AV can’t detect and prevent them. The attackers are more clever than ever to construct a payload that can exploit the system without the knowledge of AVs. Behavioral monitoring is necessary to detect these next generation attacks. There is ton of security practices for end-users to avoid these exploits from getting inside the system. Check NoMoreRansom project for preventive measures. To get latest news and ransomware information, Ransomwares is a great source. Sophos Anti-Ransomware kit contains impressive resource to learn about ransomwares.Preventive MeasuresThis is the list of security tools that we can use to prevent the rasomware and exploits.Data backup schemeThere are several ways to backup your data; cloud back up or hardware appliances or both. Lacie makes high-end storage products but costly. I uses WD Passport that capable of hardware encryption and utility program that backup data automatically. For insensitive data, it is “ok” to back up to cloud storage services but keep in mind that data is at risk.Network Monitoring toolYes. Turn on default Windows Firewall. It’s a must. What we can do more is by using a firewall with advanced features that give you visual information and alerts on real-time of network traffic and new initiated connections. I use glasswire for this purpose and free version is a good start for everyone. The alternatives are Comodo Firewall, NetWrox, and so on.Endpoint Security solutionsThere are several solutions that detects prevents malwares and ransomware attacks. These tools monitor and detect the behaviors of ransomwares continuously and remediate the exploits. Some popular vendors are Sophos, Bitdefender, Kapersky, Trend Micro, Malwarebytes, Sophos, Carbonblack, and so on. Do the research for the best product that can prevent evolved and sophisticated ransomwares before selecting it.Post-RansomwareOk! we fail to protect ourselves. Before paying to the devil attackers, these are the process we can try to decrypt/recover ransomware.Ransomware DecryptorsFor some common rasomware variants, you can check decryptors tool at Ransomwares. NoMoreRasomware also have a collection of decryptors from R&amp;D team of several security vendors.Community HelpIf the decryptors are not working, Crypto Shrieff is a community program to fight rasomware and help you to decrypt the keys.Data Recovery SolutionsThis is for the scenario that you don’t have any backups and none of the above steps work. Prosoft, KrollonTrack and SEAGATE offers great data recovery programs that you can try without buying at first. In that way, you can evaluate how many percentage of data loss can recover.If you have the big question of why we are bothering recover tool since it costs money as well as paying the attackers. Check the answer from this Should We Recover Files From Ransomware – Is It Safe.EpilogueRansomware is a new breed and not as popular as malwares or virus. However, there is a great chance that it can be infected our system. Attackers are taking advantages of end-user having no-knowledge on this attack type and penetrating through the vulnerabilities of the system easily.

The same applies to men. Men even fall into the category of buying things that are useless and not make life more organizing and productive. I am the kind of guy beat myself up when I end up owning some stupid things. I believe in minimalism and the concept of “buying less” and live simply. It makes my life easy and declutter without chaos in your room. I only buy things I really need, I find it elegant and beauty in it.This is more of a personal note of why I own and planning to buy. Of course, I have more of the small items that civilized humans need like cleaning products and bedsheets. This is more of some items that I am doubtful to own but end up being useful to me. There are many similar posts on the Internet and you can google it to get a thought or two.A Job that you loveWithout this item, the possession of these materials is impossible. If you are unemployed, stop reading and go get a job or start a business.ElectronicsE-book readerIf you like to expand your knowledge and stimulate your thoughts and idea, reading is the essential habit to build up. Actual books are good if you have money and spaces for it. I bought a kindle e-book reader and it don’t let me down and boost my reading. Just get any reliable e-book reader and you will not disappointed. Don’t ask me why not a LCD tablet. I know it can do more but it can’t be a dedicated book reading gadget and distraction of course…laptopIf you are not a gamer and graphic designer, a laptop is suitable for all sort of professions. It’s small, mobile and easy to maintain. If you are fancy getting a desktop PC, ask yourself why. Do I need a resource intensive computer system? Do I need to replace and upgrade hardware components in the near future? If the answers is no,go get a laptop.Laptop ergonomics standIf you are a heavy computer user that spends like 9-10 hours in front of the screen, this is one definite thing to own. Brands and variations don’t matter. Feel it and get one. All you need is the one that can rise up the URL bar to your eyes level. Save your neck with a few pennies!!Smart TV BoxI am not talking about smart TV. It’s expensive and the features are limited. It can be android,Roku or Apple TV box that you can connect with any TVs that have HDMI connectivity. I got an android TV box with my personal setup and the things that little box can do please me well.Sound-barBig speakers and entertainment systems are awesome! It produces great sound but make your living room ugly. I recently bought a 100$ samsung sound-bar with wireless &amp; bluetooth connectivity and 80w power is loud enough for my small living room.On-ear headphoneIt doesn’t matter you like it or not.

It can also blocks distraction at work and put a sign that says “don’t f#$&amp;ing tap me if it’s not important enough”.ClothingSneakers/Running ShoeIf you don’t have either sneaker or running shoe, you are definitely living in a cave. A good pair of running shoe is suitable not only for exercising but also for outdoor walking and strolling around the town.ShoesUnfortunately, my job have strict dress-code and can’t wear casually. Black &amp; Brown leather shoes boost up your look and go for the pointy ones but not too pointy though. A square closed shoe just looks ugly.SuitFor occasional ceremony, a good tailored suit is a must-have for all grow-up men but not a fancy color. Go for a classic decent looking color that match your style and taste.Knit TieA knit tie is something you can wear it to dress up or down. I ordered one from China and it is surprising good quality. It is consider as more casual than woven tie but it seems ok for South East Asia.Dress shirtIt should contrast with the suit you are wearing it with. For e.g, if the suit color is navy blue, the dress shirt should be white or a color that is lighter than navy blue. Also,beware of the size;being too fit or too loose.Casual BlazerThis is the piece of clothes that can go with most of your other clothes; tee,t-shirt,jeans,pants or even shorts! It makes you get a look that some people called it “smart casual” and the occasions that you don’t want to look too formal and this piece of clothing solves the problem.Oxford ShirtThis is another clothes that can go with anything. Go for long sleeves because you can fold the sleeves up anyhow.BeltsTry to get a color matched belt for your leather shoes. Wearing different color of belt and shoe just look odd.

I heard the news that Fitbit is buying some assets of Pebble and I read a post that says something like “it’s a time to buy one if u want it”. I want Pebble since the first OG but I didn’t have a chance to buy it for several reasons. Now, I am capable of having one easily from local reseller and just a thought of “why I should not own one now?”.I ordered it from e-commerence site and it arrives the exact day the company shuts down. I was having doubt that should I return it or keep it. In my unconscious mind, I want to keep it and after resolving what I want from a smart-watch, I decided to keep it. This is a list of what I want want from a smart-watch at this time of writing:1. Clock, Alarm, &amp; Timer2. A quick glance of notification before reaching the phone4. Good Battery life5. Sort of activity tracking (even though I didn't care much but it's cool to have it.)6. Water Resistance7. Remotes for Kodi and SpotifyI tested Gadgetbridge and it seems pretty ok for most of the features. I don’t know about third-party apps support and which apps are working yet.

A freelance journalist from WEIRD magazine caught an interest on the answer with some follow-up questions. He is working on a piece about technolgy changes and impact on Burmese citizen or similar topic. I took this as a change to write my personal story of what I went through and how I expose to technology and working as a career in IT.I wrote it on a limited time due to my busy schedule lately. It’s more like a drafting and bear with it. I recommend to start with the Quora answer and go on the questions.First Q&amp;A1) What incidents were you referring to when you wrote about the following? How do you think that people respond to the internet when they don’t know how to use the internet “properly and legally”? Do you think Burmese people were prepared to so suddenly get access to the internet?“The first major problem that causes from exposing internet is breaking cyber ethics and internet laws. The first reason is because people don’t have fundamental knowledge about “how to use internet properly and legally?”. There are several incidents that happen at 2014 from social media platform due to the breaking of internet law (which people don’t know).”Facebook is the main social media that Burmese people uses and there are several incidents about harassing and posting obscene things about public figures especially politicians. The quality of these incidents reduces after 4 or 5 initial offenders have to go to the court for trials and end up with jail time or other punishment. The reason behind this is that common people don’t know the constitutional law and telecommunication law that they violated. E.g.The following URL is the news about a burmese lady that post on facebook about Aung San Su Kyi and sentenced to jail for 6 months:https://www.rt.com/news/327262-myanmar-facebook-comment-jail/I often see people writing very vulgar comments that don’t even have personal impact. It can be seen by his/her relatives and friends that is very shameful and embarrassing. For some unknown reasons, I don’t understand why they seems very OK about that with their true PII. Lack of Social Media Ethics I guess.If you look at journalism world, the well-known journalists are also not ethical by writing things based on a reliable fact and information. E.g.There is an ongoing case about 2 journalists from one of the biggest media company whom defames the Yangon governor. https://cpj.org/2016/11/two-myanmar-journalists-arrested-on-criminal-defam.phpIMO, I don’t think the majority of Burmese people are definitely not ready to use the Internet for other purposes than social media and communication.2) Also, do you have any suggestions for people I should talk to–either your friends or well-known tech people in Myanmar?The following list is local/foreign tech people and journalists that you can talk with;I deleted the list of people here for their privacy.Who are the most interesting people in tech in Myanmar?Peter Chou is a former CEO of HTC who was born in Myanmar and supports good burmese localization on HTC products. Apart from that, I don’t know and have much influence on other burmese tech people.What are the craziest stories involving how tech has changed life in Myanmar in the last few years? What are the craziest ways the sudden influx of mobile phones and internet has transformed Myanmar? I’m really interested in personal stories that illustrate these larger trends.I was born in a small town and the first time I touched a computer is at Grade 7;12 or 13 years old. It was part of the school program of mid-school high scored students. The computer is Macintosh II that looks very much like CRT TV that my family owns. My first thought is like “what is so special about this TV?”. The program is pretty boring that students are allowed to use mouse in turn to click the correct words according to the image on the screen.I was moved to the City at grade 10 and stayed with my uncle who is an architect that uses CAD tools for his job. I learned how to use computers properly and built an interest on IT. After high school, I studied Computer Science at University of Computer Studies Yangon at 2003. The price of mobile phone from MPT at that time is almost the same cost with a new motor bike. Only rich people can afford to own one. I don’t even own a computer until I turn to 21. My mom bought is for me after my first year at university which is even less than half the price of a GSM mobile phone. To make it clear,the handsets is nothing. A working sim card is the thing that expensive. (Thanks to the junta government.)My expose to internet is at 2004 or 2005. I asked a fellow classmate to teach me how to use internet and still remembers his face that express “really!?”. He creates this email account and show me Google. And he said “That’s it. You can explore. Just don’t get broke by wasting too much time at the internet cafe’.” The speed is around 0.01 MBps and the gateway server stops working now and then. Home internet subscription was really expensive and it is still expensive now for middle class people.The boom of internet usage happens after the goverment opens the market for cooperate companies to invest. Telenor and Oreedoo gains market share from MPT that control telecom market. Every one can afford to own a mobile phone and telecommunication is much better. Some useless telecom government projects just ends up being a service nobody uses. E-telegram is a project I was part of the development team. The service is somehow userful back then but useless at this point.URL: http://www.etelegram.net.mm/3) What things do you think I should be paying attention to as I write this? What might I overlook?This is difficult to say at this point. There are many things going wrong and I think you can cover as much aspects as you can. I have no idea about this.Second Q&amp;A1)I’d be interested in hearing more about what growing up in Myanmar was like for you and how you became interested in technology. What was the village you grew up in like? What was your experience of modern technology like there vs. what it was like once you moved to the city? It seems like you first got interested in computers in the city. Can you give me more details about the time you saw your uncle’s computer and got interested? What captured your interest exactly? Pretend you’re telling me a story, so I understand exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time.The town I grew up is called “Thanbyuzayat”. “Zayat” is a free lodging place that travelers can sleep and “Thanbyu” means tin material. It’s a nice small town and well-known for Thailand-Myanmar Death Railway during WW II. Technology is limited to radio, cassette tapes, televisions and VCR sets back then. Black out is like all the time and the time you get an electricity is the time you enjoy your choice of entertainment. My family don’t have electricity generator because my mom thinks it’s a waste of money. One of the routine of my father is to carry 2 heavy car batteries to a charging station and wait for a day. We can have screen time the next day. I still remembers a funny story about my first World Cup at 1998. It is a final match and the battery run out of juice before the match finishes and we have to open the windows to listen from neighbors to know which team wins the cup. The first time I see a CD player is from my father’s friend visited from the city. He brought a walkman that I am like “Wow!! This circle disk can skip a song in a sec. Not like the cassette tape player that takes forever…”. My elder brother is the one who introduces me to console gaming. It’s a gaming station with 1 single Nintendo console that kids are queuing to play. Later on, a business man opens a bigger one with several Nintendo consoles. That’s where I mostly spend my pocket money and weekends.When I moved to study at the city, the school is the same with a slightly different environment. My uncle home office is the place I spent all my summer break and weekends. He already know that I like to read books and have a curious mind on things based on my father stories of how I try to disassemble his cameras and PDA into pieces. My uncle introduces me with technical books and just let me do whatever I want with the PC after he explains basic knowledge of Windows 95 around 30 minutes or so. I am very excited that I have an access to the so-called computer. As a 15 years old, my major interest is games folder of course. My uncle is let me play games with a time limit and asks me to do some typing lessons. After I got familiar with the keyboard layout and basic OS, I open the applications I think interesting and play with it. The root of my interest on technology come from my curiosity of gadgets. I didn’t have any clear objective that I want to do this or that. I was just enjoyed using computers and I made a decision that my dream job is “computer engineer” or any thing to do with computer.Lack of interest is one obvious problem of Burmese students due to the education system that don’t have activites for the students to explore things. 9 out of 10 students don’t know what they want to do when they grow up. School is just a place we go, sit, listen to teachers, do homeworks and pass exams. Not much activities expect the minister of Education wakes up with a program like “Multimedia Education” (that I mentioned previously). After the matriculation exam, the university you can enter depends on your scores on the exam. If you get high marks on the exam, students tend to enroll for medical school that is “popular education” at that time and it is still the same trend now. Every parents want their kids to become a doctor including mine. I just did ok at the matric exam to avoid the pressure from my parents and go to the computer college. There are even examples of famous people who spends 7 years in medical school and do something unrelated with medical field like a well-known,writer, Ju.2) What was computer college like if all of the access to the internet was so restricted?Burmese education system focus on quantity rather than quality. The Computer Institution I studied is located at Yangon and there are around 2000-3,000 students at my first year. I am like “damn..so many people into IT major”. However, it found out that the majority of student are just joining the institute based on the limitation of high school matric exam score without much interest. I know so many people from this institution but not even 50% of them works in IT related businesses/career. Of course, we have a big-ass lab full with computers with no internet access. There is one lab class every week but students only go there to sign up attendance sheet to fulfill one of the stupid requirement of the program. The requirement is “every students require 75% attendance to sit a final examination”. Obviously,I didn’t learn anything inside the lab. The classroom is similar with high school. Text books and note taking with teachers trying their best to explain complicated. No computers involved. Some rich kids have phone that they play.Some courses are just funny and crazy like programming courses. Teachers are teaching on white board and students are looking at teachers writing some alien-sorta-look-like-English language. The same method applies for programming exam. We solves the program snippets on the paper. Debugging is not a thing.As for me, I relies on my English comprehension skill and try to read the text books by myself. I just really want to understand how things work. I met with some students who are also into IT and we shared about the concept and ideas outside the class. I graduated as one of the top 10 students after 3 years and continues a one year honours class because I don’t know what to do yet. During my honors year, I got a chance to participate ITU Youth Forum 2008 at Bangkok as Burmese representative. It just happens out of blue after the dean call out top 10 students from each years(2nd,3rd,honors and master) to write an essay. The essay is about “the idea to reduce the digital divide between rural and remote area”. The teacher said people can use any materials during the essay exam. I have no idea what the other students are looking at the book into. I wrote A4 paper contains few ideas. The university selects 2 male and 2 female students and the ITU selects 2 students. At the end, I got an email that says I was selected to attend with the attachment of air tickets. I called my parents and they are shocked with excitement.That is the event that change my thoughts and view of the world. I met with 2 people from every 50 Asia Pacific countries. After interacting with these people from different culture and background for a week, there are so many skills that I need to acquire to learn.3) Can you tell me more about the E-telegram? That seems sort of funny.After I graduated, I was trying to enroll at Singapore university for Master degree. It didn’t happen because I can’t afford the living expense and study cost. I joined a local software company as a web developer for 2-3 years. Most of the projects I worked at that company is government project and E-telegram is one of them. The objective of e-telegram is to send telegram to remote areas that don’t have an access to internet. For e.g. a sender sends a telegram from the web services and the message is transferred to the nearest telegram office with internet access. Afterwards,the message is printed out and send to the destination through as traditional telegram. It sounds like a good idea but very few people uses it back then. I think people prefers talking over the phone than a telegram.4) And I’m curious, why did you leave Myanmar? Did it have to do with wanting more access to technology?After working at Yangon around 3 years, I decided to go to Thailand for several reasons. First, I got a offer letter from No.1 public university in Thailand. Second,I still can work as a professional during my study.I works at the research lab during my study. Third, Thailand is affordable with good living standard and similar culture with my motherland. Technology is also more advanced than Myanmar and I don’t need to struggle a lot for a living. As for now, my current position is InfoSec Engineer and I am not sure there is a position in Myanmar if I want to go back and work. The newly formed government needs to create jobs to save “brain drain” because the majority of IT people had been going abroad. The idea behind is that “it’s the same job and responsibility. Why not going for a job with a better pay and a better life?”. The family we left also get benefits from our savings. it’s a win-win situation for everyone. The Burmese economy is not stable and the living expense of Yangon is higher than bangkok. The income of middle class and white collar job don’t have a positive balance with living expenses. a handful or rich people is getting richer and the rest of the public are just poor and poor. Thanks to the junta government for their outstanding regime! I hope a new government makes a positive change for the well-being of the Burmese citizen." }, { "title": "2017 Reading challenge", "url": "/posts/reading_challenge_2017/", "categories": "Book, Yearly", "tags": "Book, Sumary", "date": "2016-11-09 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "I make a list of selected books I want to read since 2015 and try to stick with it.

The tools are based on personal experience and inputs from the colleagues. Due to my Computer Science background, I like to explore software tools that can automate and make things easier without complication. I categorize the tools by similar product categories with brief explanation of what this tool can help you in the research process.Paperless literatureAt the early stage of research, we deal with tons of papers and articles. We print them out..note them and lose them somewhere in the stack of paper. Organizing the printed hard-copy is a time consuming task. What if we can’t find the statement from 1 paper and can’t find them in the stack of paper, it is really frustrating.Using paper organizer/reference manager is a working solution to solve this problem. (Saving pdf copies of them in a traditional method is ok but still not the optimal solution IMO.)Options are Mendley Endnote ZoteroOne of these 3 solutions is the best reference manager available at this time of writing. It have several useful features such as annotating the reference,importing and exporting citation,and downloading files and meta directly from the web.1.Resources 2.Resources 3.ResourcesAnother task we do it time by time is searching keywords of the research interests to catch up the trend. For e.g., I search several databases of keywords (Browser Forensic, Digital Forensic,Private Browsing..) to read and review latest publications. There are no academic search engines that cover the entire published researches. wiki provides lists of academic databases for various disciplines.Some of my picks are Scopus by Elsevier, IEEExplore by IEEE, SpringerLink by Springer, CiteseerX by Penn State Uni and Google Scholar.Writing without pain in the neckI spent a lot of time on this part to discover the ultimate writing tool to write academic paper and articles effectively. Many people are satisfied with MS Office suite. Do writing on Word and draw stuffs on Visio and Excel to handle tabular numeric data. I prefer to avoid using MS Office because I don’t stuck in vendor lock-in. I use Google Docs for writing for my thesis documentation but it is still lack of some features that make the writing experience smooth and easy.IMO, Latex is painful to get started but it is the most convenient format to write academic articles. Why? Integration with bibliography, reference feature and the most valuable feature is publication templates. Overleaf is my platform of choice for writing latex. It it a web-based academic writing platform with version control and full support of Latex with choice of publisher templates. Gummiis a Latex tool I used for off-line writing.Other options are Authorea Sharelatex GingkoBackup for the disasterEveryone knows there is a chance that you can lose your data by Human error such as accidentally wiping out the project Hardware fault Disaster and theft Other unexpected strange incidents like spilling coffee over the laptop…For these reasons, it is important to think of a fool-proof method to back up data safely on local and/or remote location. Cloud is a good solution and Google Drive, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive is the best solution out there. It’s wise to keep local backup on external HDD or just a thumb-drive. If you are familiar with version control systems, it’s also a good solution since it keeps a backup series of the project.Other useful toolsThere are also many tools you might need that depend on your project. The following are some of the tools I personally used for different purposes.Note-taking and draftingI prefer clean minimal note taking app like moo.do. Evernote is also a popular note taking app. If you wants a bit of formatting, try any markdown editor like stackedit.Online ReadingI like to highlight and read page directly at the page like similar reading experience from medium. There are several browser add-ons to achieve that and my favorite ones are Highly and Markticle. Grammarly browser addons do several functions including highlight-dictionary that is very useful while reading.BookmarkingThere are many searching and saving resources throughout the research process. Pocket is my personal favorite for one-clicking saving from your favourite browser with tags support. Pearltrees provides organizing and collaborating by category of your preferences. Saved uses a different apporach compared with other link management services by typing saved.io/ in front of URL to save the page. Raindrop is for people who like to curate just a photo,video and content like Pinterest style. ProductivityProductivity is something many people chasing for but only some get it to a certain level. Distraction is the main thing that slow down your productivity followed by interruption, laziness and lack of self-motivation and other emotional distress. Time tracking is one thing that most people do with scheduling and planning in many different methods and techniques. Pomodoro is the popular technique to focus on what you are doing and tracking the time with a short and long period break.Procrastinating needs to beat with scheduling and planning with to-do list and scrum method. There is one product that stand out by blending Pomodoro technique and To-Do list called Pomotodo and it works pretty well for me. Trello becomes a standard tool for scrum task and tracking the progress. As for serious time tracking, tools like Rescuetime works nicely with reporting on how much time you spend on which apps. Toggl is also a great time tracking platform but it’s not available for free.OutroI hope I help you on your search of tools and tips to improve your research process and I left off some topics like diagramming and statistics tools to limit the length of this blog.

Refusing to go to some high-traffic destination. Comfort. Safety.I ran into 2 blog entries that highlights some aspects about owning a car vs Uber or Lyft and decided to added some personal opinions.

The following list shows the problem of owning/driving a car at BKK Parking parking parking… Traffic Maintenance Additional cost of car such as parking ticket, speeding tickets and accessoriesOf course! there are several advantages of owning a car. You don’t need to wait. Drive whatever you want. Don’t need to worry about bad driver. You can customize it the way you want. These are the advantages we can’t get from Uber or public taxi. I have bad experience with some Uber driver such as awful navigation issue, small and uncomfortable car, unreliable driver and so on.Apart from the cost efficiency point of view, it is more of personal preference and people who like to drive continues driving with the known trade-offs of driving. The previously mentioned buzzfeed blog said “owning a car will become a thing of the past.” but it’s a difficult thing to say now. I don’t like to drive but most of my friends like to drive.

The attackers have specific objectives, methodologies and strategies to achieve their goals with high persistence. So, Human is the major vulnerable point in organization security and by strengthening your personal security, you can avoid from being a poential vulnerable target. Traditional username/password is not a strong and secure authentication method anymore, which is the reason why many online services are exercising multi-factor authentication MFA and 2FA via Github. This blog entry is to explain a gentle introduction of multi-factor authentication in a simple and uncomplicated manner for general public.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)This is not a new concept for everyone. If padlock is not secure enough, we add a new layer of security with access card, home security system or an extra padlock to tighten the security. Withdrawing cash from ATM machine requires PIN number (something you know) and ATM Card(Something you have).MFA contains at least 2 of the following authentication mechanisms to get access to a certain system which are Knowledge (something you know; passwords,PIN) Possession (something you have; Mobile Phone, Access Card, Contact Card,Tokens) Inherence (something you are; Fingerprint, Iris, Face, Voice)2nd Factor Authentication (2FA)At this time, the most popular and practical 2FA authentication method includes user’s mobile device by sending SMS of the verification code or Authentication app that generate 6 digit tokens. I personally prefer authentication app since it’s a bit more convenient than SMS messages. Another reason is that an attacker can exploit your SIM card or simply call the service provider for a new sim card. Authenticator app like Lastpass Authenticator generates token in a timely manner and also have a single-tap login feature.IMO, FIDO Protocols presents reliable authentication option but it needs additional device or device with biometric modalities support. At this time of writing, 2FA is still the best authentication option for the majority of on-line web services with some painful drawbacks. 2FA shows a list of websites that supports 2FA authentication options.The following section is a generic starter guideline to improve the security of online services:1. Use Password Managerit’s better than same passwords for all websites. Use 1 hardcore strong master password with high diversity and combination. It improves your productivity by autofilling the username and passwords.Services: Lastpass, Dashlane, LogmeOnce, Keeper, StickyPassword2. Turn on 2FA authentication OptionI know it is tedious and time consuming but it’s better than exploiting your data to the attackers’ hands.So, turn on 2FA authentication via email, SMS, or Phone Call.3. Use 2FA authenticator app (Softtoken)SoftToken vs SMS is a controversial topic among security experts and I prefer Softtoken app rather than SMS 2FA option. It’s more convenient(QR Code Scan), No additional cost but to keep in mind that it’s also an application that can be compromised by malwares to transmit TOTP to elsewhere.Services: RSA SecurID Software Token, Lastpass Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator4. Spend few dollars on Hardware tokens/USB Security KeysHardware tokens are around for a while and it provide stronger security than SMS but it’s not necessary and provided by most of the online services. FIDO USB Security Key (USB Dongles) such as Yubikey are more practical for daily basis usage of online web services. The leading online company such as Google, Github, and Dropbox are started to adopt U2F options for the system. These tiny keys don’t need any drivers and can use it directly at any Operating System platforms with ease. The USB keys are also pretty robust and can attach it with your physical keys. Check DongleAuth to see which sites are supporting USB Security Keys.5. Stay tune for security trends and best practicesKnowledge plays a critical role in securing your personal data and preventing the potential attacks.

The only way to do at Windows 10 is by pressing “Win+Tab” and dragging the apps into the desired workspace. It might be better if I can just press the shortcut to move the active app to another workspace.Hot CornerThere is no hot corner feature on Windows 10. Unity or Cinnamon(my favorite DE) have an option to customize the actions for each corners of the screen such as “Showing Desktop”, “Spreading out Apps” and “Showing the Workspace Layouts”. It saves time and easy to jump to another workspace.No customizationThere is no customization for keyboard shortcuts and it fails me since I uses both Linux and Windows and I would like to use the same key mappings across these two platforms.

They can be forgotten. They are easy to be revealed by phishing, key-logging and other social engineering attacks. Strong passwords need to have many factors and complex combination to avoid brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks and the main problem is people tends to use easy to get personal information as passwords instead of high complexity passwords that take years of enumeration time to decrypt it.Traditional authentication process is not reliable anymore and 2nd factor authentication (2FA) and multi-step authentication become a critical protocol to escalate the privacy of user data and organization data. However, 2FA (Tokens, SMS, OTP) protocols are expensive and/or with low User experience and also other protocol specific issues.What is FIDO ?To improve the user experience and increase the privacy level and protection level of user data, a new standard is introduced called Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) authentication standard which contains 2 protocols; Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) &amp; Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). FIDO Alliance is formed by 3 technology and security leaders: Yubico, Google, Paypal, MasterCard &amp; Visa. Let’s go to the next section to see what these protocols can do and how it can overcome the issues of 2FA protocols.What FIDO protocols can do?UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) ProtocolUAF protocols offer password-less experience to the user by using biometric modalities and USB security key as an easy to use authentication method for web and mobile applications. Compared with traditional authentication protocol, UAF uses biometric multi-authentication through biometric software/hardware devices to log in to the system. The following demo video shows how UAF protocol uses TouchID to log in to the website in few seconds. The advantages over the U2F protocols is that it can avoid social engineering and phishing attacks and other data tampering attacks. The limitation at this time of writing is the support of mobile devices that supports fingerprint scanner and also adoption of the protocol in the majority of the applications. The overview and detailed specifications of the protocol can be found at FIDO Alliance Specifications Overview.UAF Biometric Login DemoU2F (Universal 2nd Factor) ProtocolU2F is multi-factor authentication protocol for existing online applications by adding a strong 2nd factor authentication to strengthen it. The progress of U2F &amp; other 2FA adoption can be seen at dongleauth. The user experience of U2F is improved compared with other 2FA protocols because of U2F supported USB key-chains are durable, ready to use and prevent phishing attacks. Google U2F:Overview is a quick review of U2F protocol presentation slide from Google. It highlights the advantages of U2F protocol over traditional 2FA protocols such as SMS,OTP and Software/Hardware tokens. The video clips shows the demo of U2F log-in procedure using Hypr-3 U2F Bluetooth Dongle.HYPR Biometric FIDO U2F and OTP TokenThoughts and ProgressFIDO Protocols are still in the early stage but it shows potential to solve security issues for data-sensitive applications,especially in financial domain. There are several open-source implementation of the protocol that can be a starting point for implementors and developers; eBay Implementation of UAF Server/Client demo Google U2F Reference Implementation An open-source FIDO Certified U2F server Yubico Python U2F Server Implementation Yubico Python U2F Host Implementation" }, { "title": "ZawDecode - Potential & Ad-hoc Review", "url": "/posts/ZawDecode/", "categories": "Tech, Myanmar", "tags": "Font, Standard", "date": "2016-07-03 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "Back to previous blog post on the issues with Burmese digital writing fonts standard, people are still pointing fingers and a fool-proof solution is far away to settle on either Zawgyi or else. A friend shares me a Facebook post about a new font, Pyidaungsu Zaw Decode, that created by a researcher who is working at Myanmar Unicode &amp; NLP Research Center. The font promises to render both Unicode and Zawgyi fonts and it seems to have a high potential to tackle the issue. The following is download URLs for True Type font and Android APK executables. TFF APKThis blog is to review and evaluate the potential of this font whether it can solve this issue. I am aware that it’s still in production stage which might encounters font rendering issue.InstallationInstalling TTF font can be done easily with default font installer of the targeted platform (Windows,Mac &amp; Linux distros). However, it is a bit tedious for Android system. First of all, the phone needs to have a root privilege to change default system font. The second consideration is to switch font after installing the APK file using Android Font changer app. I use iFont that works fine and can restore to Factory Font with just a click. Go to MyInstall for custom installation of ZawDecode Font and the app restarts the system to switch to the new font.Is it work?I uses the web page that contains first section for Zawgyi font and second section for Unicode font to evaluate the correctness of rendering both Zawgyi and Unicode font. The web page shows that Zawgyi font rendering is not 100% correct but Unicode rendering is almost perfect with some incorrect rendering, which can be seen at the below figure. Typing Burmese with this font also gives an incorrect output with common Burmese android keyboards like FrozenKeyboard 2.A question rises that this point is that “Does this font needs a specific supported keyboard to type either Zawgyi or Unicode?”. Another question that needs to clarify is that “Is it only to decode either Zawgyi or Unicode without consideration of writing/typing?”I am aware that this is still in the early stage of development and the development teams can fix these issues to make it compatible with both Zawgyi and Unicode in the near future. I am just an enthusiast to solve this issue in the near future because it can drag down the advancement of technology in most aspects especially in digitalization and telecommunication." }, { "title": "Digital Forensic Resources", "url": "/posts/DF_Resources/", "categories": "Security, Forensic", "tags": "Tools, Research", "date": "2016-04-05 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "IntroductoryThe purpose of this article is to list down books and learning resources for Digital Forensic self-learners and new comers.

It’s a beautiful creative project, which creates real world scenes with small scaled objects. The author of the project posts 1 creative idea per day in a chronological order. The only way to get access and acquire these images is by visiting project social media pages or the project official website.I was just thinking a way to download these photos into my local image repository and enjoy as wallpaper and so on. So, why not analyze the site structure and try to scrap these images for inspiration. I think the author might not mind for personal use of these images since these images have been sharing across the social medias.Web Scraping 101After researching about half an hour, I decided to use two major Python libraries for this mini-projects which are BeautifulSoup and urllib2. These two libraries become a de-facto standard for web scraping with Python. I also decided to use argparse library to handle arguments to download images for today or images of the past whole month.The following listing is sort of a breakdown plan for to achieve this web scrapper: Analyze website information structure. Extract the images from the server through “src” of HTML img tags. Create a function to ask,store and retrieve folder path to store the images. Use argument parser to ask user to download today image or images from the entire past month. Some error handling.The final python script of this project can be see at scrap_miniature.What are we looking for?The first thing to do it to learn a bit about these 2 Python libraries; BeautifulSoup and urllib2. The documentations are pretty straightforward to start working on it. I browse the website and use Chrome developer tools to examine the location of the img tag. At the end of this process, I implemented a Python function to download images from the website. Urllib2 opens URLs and retrieve HTML content which is parsed with bs4 to lxml format. HTML elements can be extracted by using class name, attributes and also by HTML tags. In this case, I extract the img tags with attribute of height to 1080. Finally, the image path is downloaded with ‘urlretrieve’ function of urllib.# function that scrap src of imagesdef get_miniature(url,filename): try: html = urlopen(url).read() soup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"lxml\") outpath = os.path.join(out_folder, filename) # This is the html component we are looking for # &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8908\" height=\"1080\" src=\"http://miniature-calendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/160202tue.jpg\" title=\"Sand shot\" width=\"1080\"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; img = soup.find(attrs={\"height\" : \"1080\"}) print img[\"src\"]+ \" is downloading...\" urlretrieve(img[\"src\"], outpath) except: print \"URL don't exist..skip!\"Download imagesTwo functions are created to download images by today time and also loop for the whole month and download in a single batch. Since the image path is in timestamp format(yymmdd), it is possible to implement the path by manipulating Python datetime object.#download today imagedef daily(): today = str(time.strftime(\"%y%m%d\",local)) absurl = baseurl+today # concat baseURL with yymmmdd folderr today file_ = today+\"_min.jpg\" get_miniature(absurl,file_) # download photos of the whole month def monthly(yy,mm): # get folder structure like http://miniature-calendar.com/160126/ (baseurl/yymmdd/) # iterate for whole month for i in range(0,calendar.monthrange(yy,mm)[1]): day = str(yy)+str(format(mm,'02'))+str(format(i+1,'02')) absurl = baseurl+day # concat baseURL with yymmdd and each days in month file_ = day+\"_min.jpg\" get_miniature(absurl,file_)Default Download LocationAlso, it might be nice to have a feature to select a location to download the images. 3 functions are implemented to ask the user preference and save it to a flat file at home directory.

It’s a lightweight operating system from Google that centered on Chrome browser with web apps. Recently, a company called neverware releases CloudReady ChromeOS based on Google Chrominum OS project. The difference with existing ChromeOS alternatives such as Cr OS is that CloudReady ChromeOS is not based on Linux distro with ChromeOS like WM/DE.InstallationInstallation is pretty straightforward and this manual provides detailed options. I prepared bootable media with my 16GB kingston thumb-drive using Chrome Recover Tools. It took around 10-15 minutes to prepare the bootable media. After that, reboot and switch boot device to thumb-drive and the CloudReady ChromeOS is ready to roll.First ImpressionsEverthing works pretty smooth with my Asus K45V laptop and Dell Inspiron-3847. Sound, Wifi and bluetooth are working well. Both PCs run on Intel architecture and for ARM architecture, it is still need to research and test out to find out the poential issues. After signed in with Google account, it started syncing my Chrome preferences, web apps and plug-ins within a couple minutes. My thumb-drive is pretty slow and I believe that data I/O will be a lot better for USB 3.0 thumb-drive.If the user like to install on HDD of the system, it provides 2 options; standalone installation and dual-boot installation. Standalone installation wipes out the entire harddisk and install CloudReady ChromeOS. As for dual-boot installation, it only works for PC with windows operating system with UEFI boot mode. My Asus laptop has 3 OS installed; Win 10, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Kali Linux. The attempt to install ends up with an error message. So, there is no option for Linux users to side-boot this OS. Check this dual-boot requirement page to see detailed instructions.Reasons to tryThis is good for users who are thinking about buying chromebook as secondary PC. You can evaluate the capability of OS and to decide whether it can fulfill your needs. Also, it is the best option for people who own aged system with low performance. Users who tried to install crouton have issues but 1 user said there is a way to solve it. Dennis Lockhart compiles crouton to work well with Chrominum OS which I will give a try soon. If it’s working nicely with crouton, this OS gonna be a perfect alternative of chromeOS.Room for improvementsThe following listing is issues that need to improve for Cloudready beta version 4.5: Shutting down is slow and not responsive. The screen turns black and gives no output of the process. It needs advanced users option to dual-boot this OS along side with other operating system. Supports of crouton for PCs with hardware capability of running Linux apps.That’s it for now. If you haven’t tried it yet, you should try this OS as a pocket personal OS or a primary OS for your old legacy PC.

So,I decided to give a try.InstallationFor Debian system, just install it with aptitude tool bysudo apt-get install zshDetails of installing zsh can be seen at Installing ZSH.To replace the default shell to zsh, there are several ways to do it. However, I recommend installing oh-my-zsh and switching shell is done automatically.Oh-my-zshoh-my-zsh is an extension of zsh shell, which provides themes and plug-ins.InstallationIt can be installed using wget or curl bysh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"ORsh -c \"$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)\"If you encounter an authentication problem, it can be solved by downloading the install.sh file first and install it manually.FeaturesSo far, it’s quite similar to bash with additional features. It’s quite easy to adapt for bash users.For coders, I think zsh is a better option than bash. Check out this LevelTutsPlus youtube clip about how themes and plug-ins can help developers to aid at cmd tasks.From my a week long experience with zsh, The following points can be made: It’s fancy and looks better than bash. plug-ins are helpful but too much plug-ins make the shell slow down. Developer related plug-ins are really intuitive and working nicely. Error prompting and giving feedbacks and predicted actions make it friendly. Opening files and some actions are slightly slower than bash. It might be the drawbacks of oh-my-zsh plug-ins. I am still exploring the usage of zsh features from this Zsh features.So, try it and I kinda believe that you will fall in love with it in no time.Cheers!Additional reading: Unix Shells Better zsh with Prezto" }, { "title": "Lazy way to version control git project", "url": "/posts/Git-Cloud/", "categories": "Tech, Guide", "tags": "Git, Version Control", "date": "2015-12-02 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": " This is just a thought on maintaining source code on local system about the easiest and the most convenient way to avoid repetitive process.Code in CloudAs for projects working in several different computer,I think the best way to control version of the source code is to upload to cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox and so on. It’s working quite well for small to mid-size projects.For large scale projects, storage size might be a problem. The purpose of keeping inside cloud storage syncs the whole directory across your work and home PC. It skips the step of pulling the repo and merging since .git folder is syncing.

Finally,I decided to put this one for 2016.Modern RomanceI like the stand-up comedy of this Indian dude and from the tagline, I believe this book is about his ideology on modern relationship. Another fun read,I hope!F*ck FeelingsYes..People are messy. They don’t listen to you. But machine does.. People are not logical. They are abstract..but we have to deal with them throughout their life. I hope this book will guide me some tips and tweaks to handle people.The Maker’s Guide to the Zombie ApocalypseYes. I have a thing about zombies and this is like a really good idea to learn building tools and gadget with a story line of zombie apocalypse. Just order Ardunio board and Raspberry Pi and there are lots of things to start some exciting projects.Linux BibleI would be lying If I said I read the entire book cover to cover. This is a tome of Linux and I will pick few chapters I think I should know.Network ForensicI am not a network guy and my knowledge on it is kind of limited. To get a grasp about forensic point of view on network, I think this is one promising to start with.Currently ReadingSmarter than you thinkThis is a book about technology and how it is changing human mind, memory and life in general.

I finished some of them and I added more books and swap some out from the list. As for 2015, my life is full with work, thesis writing and can’t spend much time reading books. However,I finished reading few books and let do a quick review on them.Being GeekThis is a must read book for software developers and programmers who needs tips and guidances about career, development and so on. It is well organized and easy to follow.Handbook of Digital Forensics and InvestigationAs for formal knowledge about basic principles of Digital Forensic, this is a good starter point to learn fundamental concept about Digital Forensic.Art of Memory Analysis“Art of Memory Analysis” written by Volatility core developers. I read this book as a reference on my thesis writing for Memory analysis concepts and principles and I believe this is the best one at this time of writing.Linux Annoyances for GeeksAnother one is the book I forced myself to read. It’s called “Linux Annoyances for Geeks”. For a deep understanding of Linux Operating system, this is one book to skim.Me Talk Pretty One DayI like reading humour and is “Me Talk Pretty One Day” by David Sedaris. After David Thorne, I found this guy full with humours and sarcastic thoughts. If you like reading comedy book about life in general, check books from this guy.Dad Is FatAnother guy is also hilarious in his own way. I like his stand-up comedy and also his writing.

He is a martial arts master, a movie star,and a student of Yip-man and more. As for an ordinary Asian dude, I wanna be like Bruce Lee when I was young. I wanna be a bad-ass like him. Nothing more than that…But after reading a brief biography about him, it seems that he is more than what I know when I was young. He studies philosophy and even writes poetry. The following quotes are some extracts of his belief and thoughts on life, learning and working.10,000 Kicks I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.As for a coder and technical guy, I take it into ways that I can familiar with. From this quote, I have two ideas related with software development.There are two types of coder; ones who plan, code, run and debug it after a milestone and ones who debug and test at small snippets. I am second type of coders who code,test and repeat the process. In this way, I believe “losing your mind in a pile of bugs” is reduced to a certain extent.Another aspect of categorizing technician and coder is by working and learning behavior; “specialist or generalist?”. A specialist knows few things into a deep level of understanding. A generalist can capable of working with various technology and platform but knowledge on these subjects are limited. The first type of person is who knows a single powerful kick and the second type of guy is more like a person who can kick 10,000 different ways. In IT world, it’s a controversial issue to judge whether one is better than another. Due to dynamic nature of the field, technology is evolving and a specialist needs to catch up and have to learn new things. As for generalists, it is still important to understand matter to a practical level. Knowing little is harmful than knowing nothing.Blow punches or Kicks Take things as they are. Punch when you have to punch. Kick when you have to kick.This is also a nice practical thought on how to plan and get things done. Research &amp; evaluation is 2 important procedure to consider when you are initiating for a new project. There are many things to evaluate such as “which programming language to work with?”, “what kind of development methodology to exercise?”, “Tools, Frameworks and necessary technology for the project?” and so on. It is important to research and evaluate to get things done productively. Everyone wants an axe to cut a tree rather than a knife, but it’s infeasible to cut an apple with axe.Lost in a forest of thoughts If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.A frequent advice you might hear from experienced coder is that “take a short break frequently”. Programmers are like artists or musicians. They need to get into the “zone” to craft things. For me, I am not working very well in the distracted environment and worrying about else. I really need to have a relaxed mind and environment to code and I believe it’s common among programmers. Forcing yourself to solve a bug for an hour gonna make you to oversee the real problem.Many problems are solved while you are not actually not thinking about it. Just skip it and work on another thing.Just take a coffee break to cool down your brain.To recap, it can be seen that he is a practical man with simple ideas to achieve things.Learn, apply and achieve by working smart and hard.Get an idea, stop daydream and start execute it.

Instead of creating “quick fixes” to make these fonts compatible for short-term periods, this article is trying to propose methods to solve this problem for long-term benefits.Artificial Language vs Natural LanguageFor computer systems and digital communication medium, there are 2 types of language. Artificial language is to implement and to create communication between human to machines. Natural language is the medium for human to human communication. The size and structure of artificial language and formal language are limited. For natural and constructed language, the complexity of syntax, rules, and structure is complex and it is out of the structure and pattern at some parts. To standardize and meet consistency at digital communication, it is necessary to set up a standard for natural language.To solve this solution, there are characters encoding and decoding standards to blend in natural languages nicely with artificial ones. Unicode is the standard you can find in modern operating systems and ASCII is another system that uses legacy operating systems such as Windows 95 and 98. For more about character encoding history, you can look at Character encoding-wiki.Unicode Unicode provides a unique number for every character,no matter what the platform,no matter what the program,no matter what the language.That is the motto of Unicode. The improvement of Unicode standards and the reason behind all major Operating Systems use this characters encoding system is because it provides enough for all types of written words and also special characters. That’s one weakness of ASCII which is only suitable English language and provides only 128 characters.The latest version of Unicode is version 8.0 and it released at June 2015, even includes characters for emoji. For a specific language, Unicode provides technical specification and character mappings for all languages. It makes life easy for fonts creators. So, if a font followed standards and characters mapping of Unicode, it is compatible to install multiple typefaces within a system. So..what is the problem?Myanmar language &amp; characters encoding historyAt bloom of web 2.0, a local software provider from Myanmar introduces a font called “Zawgyi” to use as computerized systems such as Windows applications and web applications. The font implementation relies on Windows Uniscribe engine and at that time, there is no problem since the majority of computer users are on Windows operating system and the internet is an invisible thing in the textbook. The problem with “Zawgyi” font is that it’s partially followed Unicode standards with many overlapping characters (figures at the end of this paragraph). It becomes a national IT problem and developers of Zawgyi font after 100% Unicode standard fonts are introduced.So, the solution is simple I thought at first. Just use the fonts that follow the Unicode encoding standards. In reality, it is complicated since many systems and users are familiar with “zawgyi” font and they don’t see a problem such as system localization and incompatibility between Unicode fonts ad “Zawgyi” font. The problem becomes clear after Windows 8, OSX Lion, and mobile operating systems. OSX Lion and Windows 8 supports Myanmar language as input language and followed “Myanmar 3” font character mappings. “Myanmar 3” font is the font proposed at Unicode consortium and it becomes a standard model and all Unicode compliant Myanmar fonts need to look at “Myanmar 3” font.Unicode characters mappingZawgyi font characters mappingAt this time of writing, there are several Myanmar Unicode fonts developed such as Myanmar 3, Paduk, Tharlon and so on. In my Debian system and android 5.0, Paduak and tharlon are adapted as system language fonts. Padauk, Unicode version 6.0 compliant font, uses Graphite package instead of unscribe engine and I can’t find technical information about Tharlon. A technical white paper about Graphite engine can be seen at Graphite: Smart-font technology to bridge the digital divide. So, you might think there are solutions available and what seems to be the problem at this point. Please bear with me to next section.Solution 1.0, Solution 2.0 …Developers from different platforms are implementing various mechanisms to make a “quick fix” to solve this problem such as browser plugins, mobile applications and so on. Replacing “Zawgyi” font with system default Myanmar locale fonts and implementing binary executables to automate the whole process. In my opinion, these solutions are the unnecessary solutions that only works temporarily. For mobile platform, android and iOS releases a new version almost once a year and it is not convenient for developers to implement a new “quick fix” and also end-users have to wait until “temporary” solutions out there. It will be more challenging in near future because of Myanmar locate font will become along with most of operating systems. For e.g, android 5.0 supports full system localization and by removing or replacing the system locale font with “Zawgyi” font, end-users lose a chance to use with native language and it gives headache for developers too.There are better solutions that will be beneficial in long-term and I think it is time to work out this problem with one way or another. Stop using “Zawgyi” font and migrate to Unicode compliant font It is that simple but like I mentioned before, people are stubborn and don’t like changes. Some people propose solutions for existing systems to convert “Zawgyi” font to Unicode fonts. Please read thisZawgyi To Unicode Conversions Tips, Tricks and Risks to save the length of this article, that was published at August 2011. This is what anti-“Zawgyi” font people are trying to pursue but it is not happening until now. Make “Zawgyi” font to 100% Unicode Compliant Since it’s partially Unicode font, there is a possibility to make it 100% Unicode font. Old versions of the font need to stop using and it is necessary to encourage users to use the latest one. End-users will keep using it with slight changes in typing but still existing applications and systems to convert from old version to “Zawgyi” 100% Unicode font. In this way, all Burmese Unicode fonts are compatible and the problem solves. To make this happenI can not do it alone. Other Burmese technicians also can’t do it alone. It should be initiated by associations like MCF &amp; MICA and make public announcements to make this happen. There are many hidden solutions out there such as converters, mobile applications, browser plugins and so on. The problem is not a technical issue. It’s people who need to change. I want to communicate my friends and family with Burmese texts instead of Burglish. I wanna write Burmese blogs and I wanna make hidden code comments with Burmese text. The problem of “I can’t see what you type” will be gone.Technicians and authorities should discuss this issue and try to come up with a solution. I believe that that day is coming soon and I will try to be a part of this." }, { "title": "Unofficial Facebook Messenger", "url": "/posts/Unofficial-FB-Messenger/", "categories": "Tech, Apps", "tags": "Social, Programming", "date": "2015-04-12 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "Offical Facebook MessengerLast week, Facebook announces its messaging platform for web and you can log in here.I was not really impressive with the look and also have a security concern about ‘shoulder surfing’ since it is really easy to read full screen chatbox from a certain distinct.I believe people from Facebook should develop a native application for all major platforms (Windows,Mac, Linux).

Just google “decluttering wardrobe”.Some people might this “is this really a thing to talk/discuss about?”. In my opinion, it’s important to think about for so many reasons. People buy clothes to wear it. Unfortunately, If you have a pile of clothes and you can’t spend time to maintain it, clothes wear you. From a t-shirt you bought, there are many thing you have to give for this one t-shirt. A place at your wardrobe. A place at your laundry list. A thought to remind you when to wear it. Extra 3 minute for ironing one more shirt.What’s so special about this post?This is not an article that guides you what to do. I read so many “do this,do that” article. I do laundry every 2 week,twice a month. My wardrobe is almost empty every 2 weeks. I spend around 2 hours ironing clothes. That’s it. That’s it. No more unnecessity and no chaos. I like to keep things simple and straightforward.This is how I declutter my wardrobe and tips on how to make things simple.Last In,First OutKeeping clean and downsize wardrobe doesn’t mean “anti-buying” clothes. I am not living in a jungle or a cave. I have to look sharp and neat. People treats you better if you look neat and clean. I work at a molecular biotech lab and i usually wear informal. There is no dress code since it’s a research lab. I only wear formal for some occasions and one time, the old janitor greets me nicely because of the formal clothes. What I am trying to say is that people treats and distinguishes people class by clothing.I categorize my clothes into 4 groups; ones just bought recently (1), still ok (2) and weary ones (3) and clothes to give away (4). When I buy a new cloth,I shifted one cloth and move to next group. I wear number 1 and 2 as office wear and casual wear. For group 3, I wear it while I am staying in and put in the bag to give away for group 4.The purpose is to keep the ideal number of clothes I need without piling up bunch of clothes.Some productivity tips for clothing maintenance I usually iron shirts and hang them at the wardrobe because folding them takes time. For t-shirt, I keep them in several stacks according to my predefined groups. Learn to iron quickly and systematically. So,you don’t need to spend like 5 minutes to iron one shirt. Check out this how to iron in 90 seconds.. This is how I iron clothes but it takes like 2 minutes per shirt because I also iron the back of the shirt. When you are ironing, concentrate on what you are doing instead of watching TV or other multi-tasks. Fold your socks in pair,so you are not gonna have a problem of missing sock. It’s good to separate sports wear and do a separate laundry because these clothes are stinky and dirty. For jeans, jackets and thick clothes, it is not necessary to wash it quite often. Using too much detergent is also a bad idea since it can wash out the color of the jean. Use more fabric softener and less detergent on these thick multi-layered clothes. For bobbles or lint balls, use old razor blade and it works like magic. For stinky shoes, put them in zip lock bag and freeze them over night. For stain removing, this stain removal from clothes cover intensive cleaning tips for different type of stains.So, you might be thinking that’s a lot of stuffs to swallow. It’s worth to learn and there is several benefits from knowing these tips and tricks.Clothing &amp; TravelingFor a frequent traveler, they have their own system of organizing clothes. For a occasional traveler, it is difficult to estimate the type of clothes and the quantity to put in the luggage. There is no simple equation to make it easy.

For hardcore keyboard lover and people comfortable working at terminal, VIM is the best friend you can get for writing scripts, codes,a blog post or anything. Another advantage about learning vim mode and its shortcuts to navigate,modify text is that it is available as plug-ins for other text editors and IDEs. For instance, SublimeText,Brackets,Atom have vim plug-ins to imitate similar environment. So, the point that you don’t need to learn new shortcuts and key combinations to change a text editor. Just go to vim mode and work on.Now..What?This article is about gathering sources and information for starters and also for people who are already using VIM. I will list from basic fundamental usage of vim to installing plug-ins and modifying configuration files to improve user experience.Basic of VIMOpen terminal and type vimtutor to learn basic navigation and text editing of vim. Interactive Vim Tutorials is also a good place to start learning vim. I also wrote a blog post about VIM shortcuts. Learning depth for terminal users will be much easier than new terminal users or people who don’t use terminal at all(just use notepad or something with GUI).This blog series,learning vim in 2014 is also a advanced source for starters who got familiar with basic shortcuts and usage of VIM.For guys with no idea what to do after installing vim, check out Learning Vim Progressively.Configuring VIM and Plug-ins InstallationThere are so many ways to configure VIM to meet your preferences. For a serious configuration freaks, the easiest way is to check outVim Config:Sample and Sane vim configuration. You can browse github to see tons of configuration files by serious configuration freaks.Plug-ins and its managersThere are 2 main plug-in managers(vundle,pathogen) to improve UI, to provide various language supports and to get other advanced text editing features. Personally, I prefer vundle and it is easy to manage and install plug-ins. Best of Vim collects list of great plug-ins for Vim users. Another incredible source to look for specific plug-ins for specific programming languages and specific features at Vim Awesome.Is that it?Well… If you feel comfortable and not afraid to use Vim, it can be said that you have a good start.

There might be a good reason why Google is forcing you to use its new flagship Material design. Material Design looks good and intuitive but using Google Inbox is not smooth and functional like GMail. Let’s me enlighten you why it’s that. For your judgments, all the opinions come from Web apps of GMail and Inbox.In other words, I don’t consider mobile GMail and Inbox apps.SettingsLike other email service providers, GMail provides you with advanced services like filtering, email default text setting,default signature setting and other advanced features for various level of users. Look at settings of Inbox, two things you can do literally. Turning on/off auto-bundled categories and turning on/off keyboard shortcuts.For veteran GMail users, all the settings they implemented for years just gone. It turns me off. Now, I just recognize all my email replies from Inbox without any signatures.In my option, Google should create a migration of user settings from GMail to Inbox somehow.Email ViewingTraditional email inbox is kind of static nature. An email comes in,it pops up on the inbox list. You replies the email and it creates mail-thread. I really love GMail auto categorization of emails, which Google introduces a while back. It groups email by categories and show in traditional timely manner.At Inbox, the inbox of Inbox (nested inboxes..lol!) is dynamic in nature. The categories becomes nested. Inbox orders email by timeline and followed by auto-bundled categories,which is also ordered by time-line. The unbundled emails shows as individuals,meaning that it’s not associated with any bundles. If you still don’t get it, take a look at Google inbox HelpIn my option, It’s more easier to track the defined set of websites,rather than the dynamic one with a particular pattern no one wants to learn. It’s a controversial issue and subjective.Email ComposingThe experience of composing a nice looking email at Inbox is quite terrible. Text box only contains basic formatting setting without any selection of fonts,font size and the most annoying thing is that there is no file browser for Google Drive. I work on Google Docs, Sheets for reporting and GMail works well with Drive integration. I would like to see the same setting for Inbox with comprehensive formatting settings.Nothing good about Inbox?After talking with things inbox let me down, I would like to list things Inbox is making it right. Material Design. Reminders and Snoozing. Sending yourself an email feels good. Auto suggesting email addresses you usually communicate with. Instead of zero inboxing, now you can just mark it as “Done”At the same time, I am thinking why Google doesn’t integrate these features to GMail. But, googling about Inbox gives me some thoughts on it and also why Google splits up GMail and Inbox.Further reading: Google Inbox is lousy; try it for yourself and see if you agree Why Did Google Decide To Split Inbox From Gmail?

For that reason and to see the capabilities of text editors, this is the review of best text editors for Linux platform.Sublime Text 3So far, this is the text editor leading the world of coding text editors. Many people love it and use it for various reasons. Its package ecosystem is working quite well. The UI is OK. It’s intuitive. The performance is also fast without glitches and delay. The pain is in the setup and have to make your own system to keep tracks of packages you installed and manual keyboard shortcuts.

I can’t find things you can’t do at Sublime Text which offers from Atom except native Git integration. but come on! Settings panel is a plus. It’s a lot easier for lazy people who like to click things rather than writing settings in text(like me). To sum up, some might like it and some people might not impressed.

The interface is clean and nice. Like Atom, It came with built-in package manger which Sublime Text should do. Another sweet feature is Live Review. Without any setup,it can start up HTTP server monitoring your code change and reload it as necessary. I love it. It’s possible to do it with Sublime Text by installing plug-in. CSS preprocessors and in-line editing features also work quite well and I believe Adobe aims for front-end developers. I use brackets for static site coding.

It gets cleaner look and also the animation is easy to percept by humans. Notification overlay showing is useful and annoying at the same time. double tapped opening the app from notification panel is useful. Also, notifications on lockscreen is ease to use but a bit concerns about privacy. Instead of lists, notification &amp; recent apps show as Google Now styled Cards,which is more easier to navigate but it needs time to get use to it. Long pressing quick setting doesn’t show me the specific setting and I wish this feature back. Swiping is gone in AOSP keyboard of this CM12 beta ROM. Another worth mentioning new feature is priority mode. It’s kind of “Do Not Disturb” mode with more flexible options. The user can select specific apps to give notifications. Screen pinning is also a new privacy feature added. A single app can be pinned for third party users and only the owner of the device can unlock it with the same setting you apply for your lock screen. It imitates the user accounts control of PC Operating Systems, the user can create several user accounts such as guest and other accounts for kids and your family members.

I read to think. I read for wisdom. I read for knowledge. Thisera, we have several media channels to absorb information. paper media is fading away because it is difficult to access and expensive. Fewer people are reading newspaper and bookstores turn into a museum of printed media, rather than the source of knowledge. Even in university, students use tablets and laptops to learn. Should I call it paperless-learning system? I don’t know…At the start of this year, I am forcing myself to read actual books. Books with chapter 1,2,3… Not just articles and blog posts from internet. I uploaded epub files to Google playbook platform to read it from my tablet and laptop. Still, it doesn’t feel like actual paper books which I can’t afford to buy at this moment.

As an instance, I am app-junkie. I love to touch new released apps. For this type of people, the problem is that you know many apps, which some of them does the same thing. I never stick to one app and jumps to a new one with ‘wow!’, ‘nice!’ and ‘sweet!’. For most people, I assume it might make their days easier but productivity apps decrease my productivity.In other words, I was consumed by productivity tools.Nowadays, most of the apps get mobility feature. That’s good but not helping that much in terms of productivity. Using multiple apps for various purpose will drain your time and energy. You need to get familiar with it (since it is developed by other people).For e.g,this is the possible list of apps used to increase productivity Calendars Daily/Monthly/Weekly planners Schedulers (what is the difference with planning??? :)) Reminders Time trackers Expense trackers TO-DO Lists Mind Mappers Brainstorming apps Bookmark organizers Organizers Combination of these apps (moo.do) By the look at this list, you will agree with me that you don’t need all of the tools. So, the question is “which ones Ineed?” It depends on your work behavior and the way your mind works. The solution is that you need a system works for you. You need to know (guess) the easiest, comfortable system for you. Yes! We should implement our own productivity system.Own Productivity SystemThis is the process of how I try to think of my own productivity system. I try various applications and tools to see how long I can stick to these apps. Google Keep is good for listings and emergency note taking. The UI of Keep is easy to find and I use it for shopping list, travel checklist and other lists. I also save photos in keep for quick access like images of visa, passport and IDs. I stopped using Evernote because it is frustrating with its features. Moo.do is good for drafting and scheduling, but I can’t make decisions of what should I use it for. Some people with horizontal mind might like Ginko. My main productivity tool is a small notebook( the one that can fit in your pant’s pocket)which you can carry around.For me, writing things down than typing it on computer is easier and comfortable. I can draw weird diagram, weird process tree, weird plans as I prefer. Just needs a pen!For daily planning,I divided 3 sections for planning; planning(not scheduling), time-tracking and notes about thoughts on the tasks.I plants a habit of planning things during dinner time or early morning at work. During lunch time, I reflects on tasks I done and adjust tasks for the rest of the day.I jot down for daily plan in a timely manner and during working on each task,track time to see the performance. Note sectionis for things popup related with tasks.It’s flexible and convenient. I also keep track of spening by at a header with number and abbrevations of spending items such as L for Lunch, T for transprots, D for dinner, B for beer and so on.Just need to maintain my notebook from forgetting ar coffee shop.For additional reading about creative scheduling,task planning and prductivity tools, this guy has several interesting templates you can print it out and use it.Check it out!DavidSeah’s blog" }, { "title": "Reset login password of ubuntu system", "url": "/posts/Reset-login-password-of-ubuntu-system/", "categories": "Tech, Guide", "tags": "Linux, Ubuntu", "date": "2014-12-16 04:56:03 +0700", "snippet": "For some stupid reason, I updated one server password and forget to note down and restart the system.

The Modern Language Association (MLA) provides explicit, specific recommendations for the margins and spacing of academic papers. (For details on MLA’s typography guidelines, see: Document Format.) But the MLA Handbook’s advice on font selection is less precise: “Always choose an easily readable typeface (e.g. Times New Roman) in which the regular style contrasts clearly with the italic, and set it to a standard size (e.g. 12 point)” (§4.2).It can be seen that you have a choice over selecting reasonble typefaces, rather than typewriter fonts and typewriter layouts. Let’s take a look at some academic papers.The following two papers is from 2 different publishers. It’s quite obvious to make a decison between these two papers about which one possess better typography.The first paper is from Elsevier and the second paper is from IEEE. Differences between these two papers are line height of header text should be aligned center vertically. Contents of both are justified but one with hypenation and another is not. Font Quality(Elsevier uses Gulliver and IEEE uses Times New Roman ) Spacing between Number and Section header Abstract section is lost emphasis in IEEE paper. Footer and Footnote difference. Elsevier uses footnote for author contact and copyright information. IEEE mess eveything up about article information. IEEE has unnecessary huge lane between two columns. Generally, the layout of Elsevier paper is working better than IEEE.At the next section, I will do some experimental layout with several typefaces to see the improvements of IEEE paper and also the process of creating these documents.Elsevier Journal Paper formatIEEE Journal paper formatHow can it be improved?Firstly, The following proposed formats don’t follow any document standards. Just my imagination and knowledge… You can decide on it’s working or not. The process of creating these documents are select a proper layout (3 differnt layouts) select a single serif font (seif font family is recommened font type for academic papers.) Arrange the information into similar groups Use my own common senseOk. Let’s take a look at 3 different documents on the same content.The common settings among these document is that margin is 1 inch, line-height is also 1,font size for conetent is 10 and font size for title is 16. Font size for header and footer is 9 points. Instead of paragraph indentation, try a blank line to create a whitespace.One thing to understand is that I created these documents with Google Doc and there is no feature to turn on auto hypentation. You can find how to turn on hypentation forproprietary word processors.Font Face: EB GaramondIt seems to be working quite well. The header and footer is getting orgranized with similar information and humanist typeface make the paper elegant.Font Face: MerriweatherThe fontface is not created for printing media but it’s suprisingly working well. It’s more easier to read, compared with previous document but the tradeoffs is that fewer words cover in the first page. Also,notice that font size 10 of Merriweather looks bigger than EB Garamond.Font Face: Crete RoundSlab serif is not a good fontface for block of texts. It’s better to use for texts within table instead of courier. The layout is not the common one used by academic papers.Font RecommendationsDr. Mark Womack said… I usually ask my students to use Century Schoolbook or Palatino for their papers. If your teacher requires you to submit your papers in a particular font, do so. (Unless they require you to use Arial, in which case drop the class.)A good serif font with proper size (10-12 points) according to the layout. 2 column layout needs smaller size than one column.Be all papers have better typography…To conclude, I belive that all publishers should exercise a good typography scheme like Elsiver do." }, { "title": "Terminal Audio Players", "url": "/posts/Music-Tuning-From-Terminal/", "categories": "Tech, Apps", "tags": "Linux, Programming", "date": "2014-12-06 16:50:42 +0700", "snippet": "This weekends, I am wondering about possibility of playing music from Terminal when you are working at remote computer.

Yesterday,I ran into one article about difference between private browsing mode of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.I made some feedbacks on this article as a conversation style. Some of the points will be controversial. The purpose of this blog is to fill in some insights on this particular topic. So, end-users and other interested parties can make good judgments on it. Most modern browsers ship with a private browsing mode that can be started independently from the main browsing session. It prevents the recording of history information in the browser so that information about the private browsing session cannot be retrieved once the window has been closed.Not most browsers. All five major browsers (Safari,Chrome,Firefox,Opera,Internet Explorer) have private browsing mode. The first one is Safari browser introduced by Apple at 2005. Basically, private browsing mode is sufficient for normal users to prevent their browsing activities. However, there are several proposed research that can recover the browsing records from private browsing session. To sum up, Internet Explorer left digital artifacts at persistent storage and the rests can be found in persistent storage or volatile data or both. While it is certainly possible to achieve the same goal manually without that mode, for instance by clearing the history, cookies and cache files selectively to erase traces, it is comfortable to use and not as time-consuming.Private browsing is easy to use but it is not possible to say the private browsing mode is equivalent to normal browsing mode plus clearing history,cookie and cache. The process flow and mechanism used in both modes are not the same. The browser vendors don’t provide these information because of security reasons but according to the existing academic forensic study, it is difficult to say the data security level of these browsing modes are the same. All private browsing modes work in a similar way. They spawn in a new browser window which is independent from the main session. Users can open tabs in the window and access as many sites as they want.According to this study, the data accessibility between public browsing mode and private browsing mode is not the same among different browsers. Chrome browser is the best browser in terms of security practices. Google introduces browser sandboxing at 2008. (I am not sure about other browsers.Please fill me on this.). Another protocol that makes Google and Firefox special is safebrowsing. Generally,it checks all URLs and downloads against the database to see possible security violation and according to the result, ResourceRequester handles the permissions of OS resource requests. There is however a difference between how Firefox’s private browsing and Chrome’s incognito mode function.Yes. It is. If you are using Chrome’s incognito mode, you may have noticed that you cannot restore a closed tab in that mode. Not every user requires that functionality but if ?you happen to use the mode a lot, you may have encountered situations where you closed a tab only to come to a point later on where you needed to re-open it in the browser. That’s not possible however and if you cannot remember the address or the site you opened it from, you are out of luck and cannot open it again.It is more like UI interaction difference than the core functionality ones. From the point of view from end-user,what you said is right but difficult to agree that this difference reflects the private browsing behavior of Firefox and Chrome. And Firefox? Firefox handles private browsing windows as their own instances. This means that you can re-open closed tabs when you are using Firefox’s private browsing mode. To do so either use Ctrl-Shift-t or right-click on the tab bar and select the undo close tab option from the context menu.Due to sandbox security, Chrome runs each tab as separate instances no matter it is in normal or private browsing mode. From a quick duckduckgoing, the similar security concept applies to Firefox like you said. However,I am not sure how it is related to browser running as its own instances. Side note: Opera handles this the same way as Google Chrome, likely because it is also based on Chromium, while Microsoft’s Internet Explorer the same way as Firefox.Yes. Opera adopts Chromium components such as blink,v8…like everything except the UI engine. IE and Firefox might have the same feature,’can reopen the closed tab at private browsing mode’. The implementation of these two browsers is like 99% different. You may wonder why the implementation differs when it comes to the undoing of tabs in private browsing. There does not appear to be an official answer for that but the most likely explanation is that Firefox and Internet Explorer handle the information on the window level while Chromium-based browsers on a tab level instead.I don’t understand the term you used ‘tab level’ and ‘window level’. Are you using a private browsing mode? Which implementation makes more sense to you?IMO, the private browsing mode should not allowed to open closed tab. It beats the purpose of it since private browsing mode try to erase all the traces left on host machine. If the tab can re-open it, it means that it is most likely on persistent storage rather than on volatile storage. I might be wrong but that’s the only explanation I can find." }, { "title": "Simple Terminal process alert", "url": "/posts/simple-terminal-process-alert/", "categories": "Tech, Programming", "tags": "Linux, Tools", "date": "2014-08-07 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "For people who are working with terminal all the time, you runs pipeline and tasks and you don’t know whethere it’s finished or not.

This is my first Linux distro and the first version I used is Ubuntu ver. 8. At that time,the internet access is so terrible in my country and I gave it up. At 2012, I restarted my Linux journey because of a new job.UnityBefore 14.04, I replaced Unity with Xfce since I feel like unity seems to be taking too much resources. Now,I am heading back to Unity to see improvement. The result is there is no significant changes with some polishes in here and there. I use Synapse instead of Hub and I still strongly believe that it should be included as default app launcher.Laucher bar can minimize to 16px is a good thing since nobody like to waste spaces. Snapping windows is working and that’s awesome. For backup and resource intensive work,I am working with i3 window manager. To conclude, Unity is the best looking window manager but the trade offs is computational power.Web AppsIt seems like a good idea but fails. I don’t like to open a gmail as web-app container which costs you around 100-ish RAM usage.Notification indicatorsIndicators are cool and handy but still taking too much resources. One weather notif indicators take around 30MB RAM.NautilusI have no problem with this wm but some tweaks like sushi should be came along with it.One problem is that for unknown reason,it seems to crash while copying data from/to external devices,especially when copying data size is in GB digits.Geek it upAs a fallback and concentration mode,I installed i3 wm that is simple tiling windows manger. You just spend some time with the configuration file and it’s good to go for tasks with demanding high computational power. I also use it to avoid the distractions of Unity graphic and UI interaction.It takes some time to get use to it but it’s worht your time.Sum upAs a summary, Ubuntu is the Linux distro that grows with me. It’s good for newbies,average users and people enjoys beautiful operating system with interaction and animation.The Ubuntu community might be the biggest one among Linux distro and for that reason, the learning curve can be slightly lower than others.

The questions I pop up when I am reading about that feature is that it is gonna work like it said,what about the limitation and what are the provided functonalities. This is gonna be a huge change for developers since it can change the way coders handle with multiple devices.Effects on web developmentUntil this point,the only way I apply when implementing a responsive website is by checking a tool like Dimensions, which is a useful chrome extension.

In this blog,I like to list down these sites and talk about it by my opinions.Khan AcademyIt might be the most popular platform for free online learning.Pros:The website is nice and interactive. It includes some features like badges for students and teachers. There is no time constraints and it’s like free-style learning without any pressure.Cons:The courses have limited number and most of the course levels are intermediate level. Good for high school and undergraduate students if they are willing to learn on their own.CourseaUnlike Khan academy,coursea is full with adanced course. Most of the courses are not free but some courses are. The courses are coached by third party institution.Pros: Good for people looking to learn advanced topic or subject. Right now,I am working on a subject called “Information Security and Risk Management Context”.Cons: There are no specific format for the courses and it can be frustrating for new students.The courses are not opened all the time and you have to wait for the course you like to join.UdemyUdemy is similar to Coursea. The quality of the course seems to be better than Coursea and the price of some courses are high.Pros: Some courses are quite expensive but still offers free courses. Nice UI and easy to follow lesson plan.Cons:all the courses are in english language compared with Coursea which offers various languages.UdacityThis is the learning platform specific for computer science field. It’s worth checking out for CS guys.Pros: Since it focus on one subject, the quality of the courses are quite good for computer sciene topics.Cons: I can’t find any thing for this one.GibbonThis one is new fish in town. Still in development and they are still working on more features.It’s not like traditional learning. People curated articles based on their knowledge and experience. If you are interested,you can follow these ‘playlists’ to learn them.Pros:Comfortable and easy to follow. You can make a learning commitment for day/week. Good for life-long learners who are willing to improve their knowledge on the corresponding area.Cons: The quality of content is depend on people and it’s not for advanced learning." }, { "title": "Shell Scripting(part I)", "url": "/posts/shell-scriping/", "categories": "Tech, Guide", "tags": "Linux, Programming", "date": "2014-03-18 00:00:00 +0700", "snippet": "There is a shell, there is a way…This is the study notes about bash shell-scripting.In part I, I would like to cover basic commands for starters.PreludeI have a memory shortage condition and this is just to warm up my scripting skills.

Let’s say around 6 months, this Linux distro fails me 3 times. Even though it said “Ubuntu 12.04 LTS(Long Term Support)”. You should call it as “Long Time to Stable”.Anyway,I have to use it and I try to find the best applications.
