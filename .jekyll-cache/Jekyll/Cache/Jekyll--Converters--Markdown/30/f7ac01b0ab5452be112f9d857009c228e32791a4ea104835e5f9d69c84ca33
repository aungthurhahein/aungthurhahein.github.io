I"‚<p>These days,people stop reading books. Technology plays a great role in that. It changes lifestyle of people, including me. Itâ€™ve been a while I stop reading actual books such as fictions, non-fictions and novels. I spent more time reading on â€˜information live for a short term periodâ€™ stuffs. Sources like twitter, RSS reader and news curated media changes the way I read.</p>
