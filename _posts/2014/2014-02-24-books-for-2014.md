These days,people stop reading books. Technology plays a great role in that. It changes lifestyle of people, including me. It've been a while I stop reading actual books such as fictions, non-fictions and novels. I spent more time reading on 'information live for a short term period' stuffs. Sources like twitter, RSS reader and news curated media changes the way I read. 

Now, I decided to change my reading habit back to old-fashioned style. Back to committed reading!! I selected to read at least 1 books per month.(Not included comics and graphic novels.)
