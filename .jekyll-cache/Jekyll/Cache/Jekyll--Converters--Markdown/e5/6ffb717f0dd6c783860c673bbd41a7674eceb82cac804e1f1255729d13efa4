I":<p>Last night, I was coding with Pycharms, which is a great IDE but the resource consumption is significant for my laptop with 4GB RAM. Running Chrome,Pycharms,terminal emulator,MySQLWorkbench &amp; Zeal slows down my machine. I am thinking of selecting another platform for small project Python coding. For that reason and to see the capabilities of text editors, this is the review of best text editors for Linux platform.</p>

<h3 id="sublime-text-3">Sublime Text 3</h3>
<p>So far, this is the text editor leading the world of coding text editors. Many people love it and use it for various reasons. Its package ecosystem is working quite well. The UI is OK. It’s intuitive. The performance is also fast without glitches and delay. The pain is in the setup and have to make your own system to keep tracks of packages you installed and manual keyboard shortcuts. To conclude, I believe it’s the best option for multi-language coders for a specific setup and standard.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language Support: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>UI: 3 out of 5</li>
  <li>Extensions: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Performance: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Configuration: 3 out of 5</li>
  <li>Features: 3 out of 5</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atom">Atom</h3>
<p>Well,IMO, it’s a ripoff of Sublime Text by Github since Github has a big fan-base of programmers. I can’t find things you can’t do at Sublime Text which offers from Atom except native Git integration. but come on! Settings panel is a plus. It’s a lot easier for lazy people who like to click things rather than writing settings in text(like me). To sum up, some might like it and some people might not impressed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language Support: 3 out of 5</li>
  <li>UI: 3 out of 5</li>
  <li>Extensions: 3 out of 5</li>
  <li>Performance: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Configuration: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Features: 3 out of 5</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="brackets">Brackets</h3>
<p>It’s an open source editor from Adobe with neat UI. The interface is clean and nice. Like Atom, It came with built-in package manger which Sublime Text should do. Another sweet feature is Live Review. Without any setup,it can start up HTTP server monitoring your code change and reload it as necessary. I love it. It’s possible to do it with Sublime Text by installing plug-in. CSS preprocessors and in-line editing features also work quite well and I believe Adobe aims for front-end developers. I use brackets for static site coding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language Support: 2 out of 5</li>
  <li>UI: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Extensions: 3 out of 5</li>

  <li>Configuration: 4 out of 5</li>
  <li>Features: 3 out of 5</li>
</ul>

<p>This one might be unique. The UI is minimal and silk. In-line code evaluation and watches are cool features. The constraints is that it only supports 3 languages at this moment,which are Clojure,Python &amp; Javascript. Dozens of plug-ins are available to install. Configuring settings is difficult compared with other text editors. I just wrote some python scripts and it is amazingly cool and intuitive. I will try this one for a while and come  back with comment</p>
