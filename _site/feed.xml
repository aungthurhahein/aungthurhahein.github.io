Standard DNS (on tcp/udp port 53) works just fine but missing security features to prevent tampering of its plaintext DNS request to the DNS providers. It leads to security issues such as DNS Cache Poisoning and typo-squatting domains. DNS Over HTTPs (DoH) brings TLS/SSL encapsulation on HTTP traffic to boost security integrity issues of spoofing and tampering of... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Blogging Platform 2022 ✍🏼</title><link href="/posts/blogging-platform/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blogging Platform 2022 ✍🏼" /><published>2022-04-11T12:33:00+07:00</published> <updated>2022-04-11T12:33:00+07:00</updated> <id>/posts/blogging-platform/</id> <content src="/posts/blogging-platform/" /> <author> <name>aung</name> </author> <category term="Notes" /> <category term="Productivity" /> <summary> I have some down time at this week and decided to reinvent my blog site with new look and organization.
