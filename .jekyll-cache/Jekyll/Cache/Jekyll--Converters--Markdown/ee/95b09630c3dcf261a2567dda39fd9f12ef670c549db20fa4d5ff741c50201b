  <li>elevator malfunction and cut through my body through half while I am approaching into it</li>
  <li>Two vehicles hit me at the same time in the middle of the road and I have no idea that I gonna die terribly</li>
  <li>I am relaxing in my apartment and the whole apartment electrocuted.</li>
  <li>Thunder strikes me while I am combing my beautiful wavy hair</li>
  <li>Slip and trip over the bathroom floor and knocks my head after falling down reversely</li>
  <li>Airplane crush</li>
  <li>Truck full of heavy objects is out of control and heavy objects such as containers and gas tanks roll over,explode and fall over the vehicle I am in</li>
