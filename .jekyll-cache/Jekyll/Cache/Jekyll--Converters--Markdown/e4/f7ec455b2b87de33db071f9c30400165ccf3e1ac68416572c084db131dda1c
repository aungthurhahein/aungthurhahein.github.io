<p>Recently, I’ve been using more than AV for my work PC to tighten the security. The landscape of the attackers is expanding to more scary things like ransomware attacks and I think it is important for everyone to understand what is <a href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/ransomware-qa.html">ransomware</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HW3NYdF8">ESET Ransomware Explained(vid)</a> is also a short nice video of what ransomware capable of. AV can’t detect and prevent them. The attackers are more clever than ever to construct a payload that can exploit the system without the knowledge of AVs. Behavioral monitoring is necessary to detect these next generation attacks. There is ton of security practices for end-users to avoid these exploits from getting inside the system. Check <a href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/prevention-advice.html">NoMoreRansom</a> project for preventive measures. To get latest news and ransomware information, <a href="http://ransomwares.net/">Ransomwares</a> is a great source. <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/lp/ransomware.aspx">Sophos Anti-Ransomware kit</a> contains impressive resource to learn about ransomwares.</p>
