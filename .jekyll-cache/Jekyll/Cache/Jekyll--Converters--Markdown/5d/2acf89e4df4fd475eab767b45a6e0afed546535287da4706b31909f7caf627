I"<<p>For guys who use terminal a lot and guys who just wanna play with new things, this is another thing the first time I try. It’s a terminal emulator but in your browser. The clos experience I had is a chrome plugin,which can make SSL &amp; FTP connection. But a terminal…I give it a try and it’s working.</p>
