I"<p>I read an article about a guyâ€™s concept of making his digital devices to minimalize for the sake of keeping his mind and work-flow simple and straightforward. After I read that, I forgot to keep a bookmark this page and couldnâ€™t find it again. The devices he have are iPad and iPhone. Itâ€™s so simple. He keeps the springboard of both his devices â€œblankâ€. Thatâ€™s it.</p>
