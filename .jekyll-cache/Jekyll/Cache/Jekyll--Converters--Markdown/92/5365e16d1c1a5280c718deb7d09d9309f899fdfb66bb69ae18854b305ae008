I"∆<p>It s the buzz word in web-design,<em>‚Äúminimalism‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>What if your life minimize to a certain ratio?</p>

<p>What if you reduces your desires and becomes anti-consumerism?</p>

<p>It follows the teaching of Buddha too. However,people likes to have <em>newest,most expensive,the rarest</em> possessions on their hands.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as one‚Äôs own in the midst of abundance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is do you need all of these belongings?</p>

<p>Do your life needs to carry all these stuffs with you?</p>

<p>Most people thinks having expensive clothings,fastest car and latest techie promises <strong>Happiness</strong>. However,I believe it can t delivers happiness and make you desire more and more.</p>

<p>People are living in this vicious cycle.</p>

<p>Recent incident with my landlord makes me realize about our complex chaos life. When we move-in, she makes a statment about the shoes me and my room-mate have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You only have 2 feet,why you needs lots of pairs of shoe‚Ä¶.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being minimalist is simple and have both beneifts and tradeoffs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My policy is think 7 days before you desire to buy an object. If you forget it,you don t need/want it.</p>
</blockquote>
