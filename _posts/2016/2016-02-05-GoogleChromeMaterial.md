Google is planning to face-lift Google Chrome ver. 50 with <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a> according to
<a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2016/02/google-redesigns-chrome-browser-for-material-design/">Web Design Depot</a>.

Currently, Chrome is version 48 on my Debian system. I found a way to enable Material Design to see an early look by the following way:


1. Go to *chrome://flags/*.

2. Look for *"Material design in the browser's top chrome"* and choose *"Material"* from dropdown list.

3. Look for *"Enable Material Design downloads"* and enable to change downloads page to MD UI.

4. Look for *"Enable material UI for PDF"* and enable it to change PDF viewer to MD UI.


Material settings page is enable by default and it can be viewed by "chrome://md-settings/". However, some functions are not working fully yet.

I leave out screen shots for your excitement!

Cheers!
