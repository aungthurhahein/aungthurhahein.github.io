A look back into 2021, it's not the year that I achieve something to proud of. The mental state of mind is not the best and the way that I look into life and the world is changed. The motherland is in turmoil and approaching to become a failed-state. Uncertainty is very high in all citizens, the people who can enjoy their lives with whatever they have. This is far worse than pandemic because the fix to this political conflict can't be methodological. People falls into 4 categories; the ones that trying to maintain the wealth and status, the ones that rival against the junta power, the one that neutral and play the dances, the ones that support one of the sides.
