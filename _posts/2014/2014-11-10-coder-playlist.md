Last weekend,I just made a static page on github to become a collaboration project. The purpose is for programmers and coders to grab hand-picked music playlists and also put ones you created or love to listen. 

Here is the address: <a href="http://aungthurhahein.github.io/coderplaylist/" target="_blank">Coder Playlist</a>.

Cheers!
