<p>I just upgraded my Ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04 LTS. In this piece, Iâ€™d like to  talk about my user experience on Ubuntu.<br />
This is personal review of Ubuntu from a average user with 2+ year experience. This is my first Linux distro and the first version I used is Ubuntu ver. 8. At that time,the internet access is so terrible in my country and I gave it up. At 2012, I restarted my Linux journey because of a new job.</p>

<h3 id="unity">Unity</h3>
<p>Before 14.04, I replaced Unity with Xfce since I feel like unity seems to be taking too much resources. Now,I am 
heading back to Unity to see improvement. The result is there is no significant changes with some polishes in here and there. <br />
I use Synapse instead of Hub and I still strongly believe that it should be included as default app launcher.<br />
Laucher bar can minimize to 16px is a good thing since nobody like to waste spaces. 
Snapping windows is working and thatâ€™s awesome. <br />
For backup and resource intensive work,I am working with i3 window manager. <br />
To conclude, Unity is the best looking window manager but the trade offs is computational power.</p>
