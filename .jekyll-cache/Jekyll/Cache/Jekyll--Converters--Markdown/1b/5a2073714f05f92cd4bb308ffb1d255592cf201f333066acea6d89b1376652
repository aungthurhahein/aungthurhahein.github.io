I"L<p>As the tile gives a hint, ctrl+space shortcut is not working system wide on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with cinnamon DE. I noticed while I was started using LightTable IDE. I asked to INTERNET people and they are giving me some thoughts. Today, I am memorizing shortcuts of Pycharms and realized that ctrl+space is not workig at Pycharms too. Waitt.. After duckduckgoing about this issue, I found a solution to fix it. The problem is that <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus" target="_blank">ibus</a> default triggger hotkey is ctrl+space and it is interrupting.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, the easiest way it to remove or edit the shortcut of ibus through dconf-editor. If you don’t have it, install from terminal as the following:</p>

<p>{%highlight bash%}</p>
<h1 id="sudo-apt-get-install-dconf-editor">sudo apt-get install dconf-editor</h1>
<p>{%endhighlight%}</p>

<p>Open dconf-editor and go to desktop&gt;ibus&gt;hotkey and remove triggers value and leave it as “[]” or set a new suitable shortcut.</p>

<p>That’s it and ctrl+space will be working for all applications.</p>
