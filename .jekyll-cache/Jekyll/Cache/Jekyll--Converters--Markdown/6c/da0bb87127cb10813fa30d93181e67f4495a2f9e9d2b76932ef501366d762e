I""<p>I wrote on a quora <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-technology-changing-the-culture-of-Myanmar/answer/Aung-Thu-Rha-Hein?srid=3sLL">thread</a> about Technology changes in my motherland, Myanmar. A freelance journalist from WEIRD magazine caught an interest on the answer with some follow-up questions. He is working on a piece about technolgy changes and impact on Burmese citizen or similar topic. I took this as a change to write my personal story of what I went through and how I expose to technology and working as a career in IT.</p>
