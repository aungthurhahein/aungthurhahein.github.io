I"¼<p>Unlike Windows operating system registry, Linux configuration is based on text files and standardization becomes an issue. For normal users or system administrators, there are several configuration files which are essential to know. The following listing describes these files with purposes.</p>

<p>This is the list of most of the directories in modern Linux systems with general description of them. Among these directories,I will extract important directories to dig deep into configuration files.</p>

<h3 id="directories">Directories</h3>
<p>There are all directories you might find in your Linux system. The best way to explorer is by using a tool called â€˜treeâ€™.</p>
