### Introductory

The purpose of this article is to list down books and learning resources for Digital Forensic self-learners and new comers. When I was started learning about fundamentals and principles of Digital Forensic and Incident Response, I had a hard time looking for the starting point. Also, most of the learning tutorials and training courses are not free. This is my collection of resources for newcomers to Digital Forensic research area.

### Publication Journal 

Thanks to the [Digital Investigation](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/digital-investigation/) Journal from Elsevier publication. I got a hand on high quality research papers and trend on Digital Forensic. 
The other journals that focus on DFIR are

* [IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security](http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/publications/periodicals/forensics/)
* [International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics](http://sdiwc.net/ijcsdf/)
* [International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics ](http://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-digital-crime-forensics/1112)
* [International Journal of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics](http://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijesdf)
* [The International Journal of Forensic Computer Science](http://www.ijofcs.org/)
* [International Journal of Information and Computer Security](http://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijics)
* [Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law](http://www.jdfsl.org/)
* [Journal of Information Security and Application](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-information-security-and-applications)

### Books

As for the books, This is the books I discovered and presented by categories. Of course, it is not necessary to read all the books. You can justify and focus on the books which provides the skills and knowledge you requires. As for the beginner, It is a good idea to start picking a book or two of fundamental and basic concepts of DF before continuing to a platform specific books. In this way, it will give you some foundation and formal knowledge required.

### Blogs & Tutorials

Except fellow twitter DFIR people and Linkedin groups, I don't read any particular blogs that focus about current trends and issues on Digital Forensic. The entry from [Digital Forensic Association](http://www.digitalforensicsassociation.org/forensic-blogs/) and also [Forensic Focus](http://www.forensicfocus.com/News/article/sid=2153/) selected 5 top DF blogs.

As for tutorials, I believe there are many paid training programs available for every aspects of Digital Forensic field. I recommend [Cybray](https://www.cybrary.it/) for computer security and forensic *free* programs and it's also a network of fellow security practitioners. For beginners with A+ and Security+ knowledge, go for [Computer Hacking Forensic Analysis](https://www.cybrary.it/course/computer-hacking-forensics-analyst/) course.

That's for now.I will update this blog post time by time based on my discovery on Digital Forensic.
