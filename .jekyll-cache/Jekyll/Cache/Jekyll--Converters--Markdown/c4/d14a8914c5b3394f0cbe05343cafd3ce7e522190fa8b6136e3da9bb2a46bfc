I"d<p>This weekends, I am wondering about possibility of playing music from Terminal when you are working at remote computer. I ran into 2 solutions to do that. It is nice to see that there are tons of pre-exisitng applications for <strong>terminal workers</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sox"><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/SoX" target="_blank">SOX</a></h3>

<p>It stands for Sound eXchange and itâ€™s a application for sound processing. It is capable of converting music format from one to another.  Also,you can use it as a simple terminal music player.</p>

<p>To play music with SOX, just need to know a bit about wildcards and terminal knowledge. To exit SOX, press Cltr-C. If you queue multiple songs with asterik wildcards,press Cltr-C twice will exit SOX and Cltr-C will skip to the next track.</p>

<p>{%highlight bash%}
#install sox and coded lib for it
$ sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all
#play music
$ ls ~/Music
#play a song
$play track_1.mp3 
#play all mp3s in a foler
$play *.mp3
{%endhighlight%}</p>

<h3 id="cmus"><a href="https://cmus.github.io/" target="_blank">CMUS</a></h3>
<p>CMUS is more advanced than SOX with various features such as creating a library, queuing selected songs into current playlists. To get the latest release version, the developer recommend to download from <a href="https://github.com/cmus/cmus.git">cmus github repo</a> and compile it.</p>
