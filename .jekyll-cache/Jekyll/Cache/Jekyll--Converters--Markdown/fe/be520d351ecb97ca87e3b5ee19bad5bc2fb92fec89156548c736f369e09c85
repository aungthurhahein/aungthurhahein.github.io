I"æ<p>December is a time you regret things you want to do, but you fail. And it‚Äôs also a moment you try to plan whether it‚Äôs realistic or not. One of the things I did for few years is listing books to read at upcoming year. It‚Äôs more like making the announcement for my commitment.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of books I love to read; Non-fiction with technical content, humor and satire books and technical books. The following listing is a list of books I picked to read at upcoming year with recommendations from friends and goodreads.com.</p>

<h4 id="crypto">Crypto</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1370798849l/984428.jpg" alt="crypto" height="300px" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs one of the IT nonfiction books from Steven Levy and I believe this book tells a story about cryptography, hacking and revolution of hackers. He published several <a href="http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php/books">books</a> and the next one I am planning to read is ‚ÄúIn The Plex‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="the-naked-future">The Naked Future</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1394997672l/18114099.jpg" alt="NakedFuture" height="300px" /></p>

<p>This <a href="http://patricktucker.com/about-the-book/">book</a> views on the perspective of evolution of technology and its affect on society. From the skimming of first chapter, it seems that the book mainly focus on big data.</p>

<h4 id="hacker-hoaxer-whistleblower-spy-the-many-faces-of-anonymous">Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1410797749l/20601080.jpg" alt="Hacker" height="300px" /></p>

<p>If you are familiar with phrases like darknet, onion network, hacking activism and Anonymous, this is a book to know more about this secret organization that fighting their belief by announcing as cyberwar.</p>

<h4 id="look-evelyn-duck-dynasty-wiper-blades-we-should-get-them-a-collection-of-new-essays">Look Evelyn, Duck Dynasty Wiper Blades. We Should Get Them.: A Collection Of New Essays</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1422459180l/23658930.jpg" alt="DavidThrone" height="300px" /></p>

<p>The third book from my favorite satire, David Throne and I don‚Äôt know what to expect from this one but believe it will be good like previous two. Check out his <a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/">blog:27b/6</a> for a taste of his comedy.</p>

<h4 id="the-hitchhikers-guide-to-galaxy">The Hitchhiker‚Äôs guide to galaxy</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327656754l/11.jpg" alt="Hitchhiker" height="300px" /></p>

<p>I know this classic sci-fi comedy for a while but don‚Äôt have a chance to read it. Finally,I decided to put this one for 2016.</p>

<h4 id="modern-romance">Modern Romance</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1432335014l/23453112.jpg" alt="Romance" height="300px" /></p>

<p>I like the stand-up comedy of this Indian dude and from the tagline, I believe this book is about his ideology on modern relationship. Another fun read,I hope!</p>

<h4 id="fck-feelings">F*ck Feelings</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1440993148l/23492600.jpg" alt="FuckFeelings" height="300px" /></p>

<p>Yes..People are messy. They don‚Äôt listen to you. But machine does.. People are not logical. They are abstract..but we have to deal with them throughout their life. I hope this book will guide me some tips and tweaks to handle people.</p>

<h4 id="the-makers-guide-to-the-zombie-apocalypse">The Maker‚Äôs Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1446416682l/26778102.jpg" alt="Zombie Apocalypse " height="300px" /></p>

<p>Yes. I have a thing about zombies and this is like a really good idea to learn building tools and gadget with a story line of zombie apocalypse. Just order Ardunio board and Raspberry Pi and there are lots of things to start some exciting projects.</p>

<h4 id="linux-bible">Linux Bible</h4>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1355106656l/13838572.jpg" alt="Linux Bible" height="300px" /></p>

<p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348237442l/13660853.jpg" alt="Network Forensic" height="300px" /></p>

<p>I am not a network guy and my knowledge on it is kind of limited. To get a grasp about forensic point of view on network, I think this is one promising to start with.</p>

As for 2015, my life is full with work, thesis writing and can‚Äôt spend much time reading books. However,I finished reading few books and let do a quick review on them.</p>

<h4 id="being-geek"><a href="http://www.beinggeek.com/" target="_blank">Being Geek</a></h4>

<p>This is a must read book for software developers and programmers who needs tips and guidances about career, development and so on. It is well organized and easy to follow.</p>

<h4 id="art-of-memory-analysis"><a href="http://www.memoryanalysis.net/#!amf/cmg5" target="_blank">Art of Memory Analysis</a></h4>

<p>‚ÄúArt of Memory Analysis‚Äù written by Volatility core developers. I read this book as a reference on my thesis writing for Memory analysis concepts and principles and I believe this is the best one at this time of writing.</p>

<p>Another one is the book I forced myself to read. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúLinux Annoyances for Geeks‚Äù. For a deep understanding of Linux Operating system, this is one book to skim.</p>

<h4 id="me-talk-pretty-one-day"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4137.Me_Talk_Pretty_One_Day" target="_blank">Me Talk Pretty One Day</a></h4>

<p>I like reading humour and  is ‚ÄúMe Talk Pretty One Day‚Äù by David Sedaris. After David Thorne, I found this guy full with humours and sarcastic thoughts. If you like reading comedy book about life in general, check books from this guy.</p>

<h4 id="dad-is-fat"><a href="http://www.jimgaffigan.com/books/dad-is-fat" target="_blank">Dad Is Fat</a></h4>
